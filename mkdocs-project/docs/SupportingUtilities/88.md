# SmDelay StateMod Delay File Program #

The StateMod Delay File Program (`SmDelay`) allows a daily StateMod delay file (\*.dly or \*.urD) to be created from an existing 
StateMod monthly delay file (\*.dly or \*.urM). The approach used to estimate daily data is to construct a pattern by connecting 
the midpoints of monthly data. The result is a smooth daily estimate. 

To execute `SmDelay` the user simply types: `SmDelay flname.rsp` where `flname.rsp` is a response file that that includes the name 
of the existing monthly delay file and the name of the new daily delay file to be created. Following is an example:

```
#
# smDelay.rsp; 
#   Response file to create a daily delay file from a monthly file
#
#
# Name                                                         
#---------------                                               
rg2005.urM	           Existing Monthly delay file
rg2005.urD                      New Daily delay file		
```
