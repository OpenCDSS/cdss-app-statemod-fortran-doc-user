# Irrigation Parameter Yearly Data File - Annual (*.ipy) #

The annual CU time series file contains information required to perform calculations using a variable efficiency approach. It is only used when 
the control file (\*.ctl) variable `itsfile` >= 1. It is formatted exactly the same as the annual time series file used by the consumptive use model 
(StateCU). The current standard is to provide four water supply irrigation method combinations (Surface Supply Flood Irrigation, Surface Supply 
Sprinkler Irrigation, Ground Supply Flood Irrigation and Ground Supply Sprinkler Irrigation). For a description of the old (\*.ipy file) format, which 
StateMod still supports, see [Section 9.0 - Discontinued but Supported File Formats](../Discontinued/91.md). 

Because multiple input file formats may be provided it is recommended the following string be provided near the top of the file before any 
data: `# FileFormatVersion 2`. If the format version indicator is not provided StateMod will try to read the file and try to determine the appropriate 
file type.
