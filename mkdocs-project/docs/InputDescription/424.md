# Reservoir Target File - Monthly (\*.tar or \*.tam) #

The reservoir target file contains monthly targets for a reservoir's minimum and maximum contents. Data should be entered in the order of the 
structure (\*.res) file. Positive maximum contents are end of month targets. Negative values are forecasted inflows. When forecasted inflows are 
provided the monthly target is estimated as follows:

$$~\text{Target} (im) = ~\text{Current Storage} (im) - (~\text{Current Storage} (im) - ~\text{Forecast} (im)
- ~\text{End Target}) / (~\text{Months Remaining} +1)$$

Where:

\\(~\text{Target} (im)\\) is the reservoir target. 

\\(~\text{Current Storage} (im)\\) is the total reservoir storage in month im. 

\\(~\text{Forecast} (im)\\) is the total inflow for the remaining forecast period. Note for a linear forecast this term is often set to -1. 

\\(~\text{End Target}\\) is the target at the end of the forecast period. 

\\(~\text{Months Remaining}\\) is the total of all months remaining to be forecasted in a year.

For example, if the forecast data for April, May, June, July is 1,000 AF, -1, -1, and 700 AF and the Current Storage in April = 1000 AF, then the Target in May is: 1000 - (1000 - 1 -700)/3 = 900. 

This file is read by subroutine **`MDAINP`**.
