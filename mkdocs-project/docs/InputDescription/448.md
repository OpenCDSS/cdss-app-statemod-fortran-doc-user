# Rio Grande Spill (*.rgs) #

The Rio Grande Spill file contains a file that indicates when Elephant Butte Reservoir historically 
spilled. Note this file is used only when the Rio Grande Compact is simulated (operating rules 17 and 
18) to determine when any debt accrued by Colorado is erased. This file is read by subroutine **`MDAINP`**.

| Row-data							| Variable						| Description 								|				
| ------------------				| --------------------			| --------									|
| Control Data						| 								| 											|
| 1	 								| 								| Format (i5,1x,i4,5x,i5,1x,i4,a5,a5)
| 1-1								| ibm							| Beginning month of data (e.g. 1 = Jan)
| 1-2								| iby							| Beginning year of data (e.g. 1975)
| 1-3								| iem							| Ending month of data
| 1-4								| iey							| Ending year of data 
| 1-5								| cunit							| Units of data ('NA')
| 1-6								| cyr							| Year type 
| 									| 								| 'CYR' = calendar year (1-12)
| 									| 								| 'WYR' = water year (10-9)
| 									| 								| 'IYR' = irrigation year (11-12)
| | | |
| For Rio Grande Compact Operating Rules only. | | |
| 2-1								| rspilx(1-12)					| 0 = No Elephant Butte Spill
| 									| 								| +n = Elephant Butte Spill Data
| 									| 								| The integer portion is the month of spill (e.g. month 6 = 6)
| 									| 								| The decimal portion is the % of Spill that was Coloradoâ€™s
| 									| 								| Note when a spill occurs:
| 									| 								| If Colorado is in debt it is erased
| 									| 								| If Colorado is in surplus their surplus is reduced by %

Repeat for the number of years in the simulation
