# Consumptive Water Requirement File - Monthly (*.ddc) #

The monthly consumptive water requirement (\*.ddc) file contains the consumptive requirement for direct diversion and well only structures for each month 
of the simulation period. For an irrigation structure the consumptive water requirement is commonly called the Irrigation Water Requirement (IWR). Regardless 
if the structure is used for irrigation or municipal or industrial use the consumptive water requirement is the amount of water that would be consumed by that 
structure (e.g. no losses or inefficiencies are included). It is only used when the control file (\*.ctl) variable efficiency variable (`ieffmax`) = 1. Data 
should be provided for every diversion and well only structure. If data is inadvertently provided for a Well structures that is also served by both Surface 
water the data provided under the Diversion ID is used. When data is not provided (e.g. for a municipal or non consumptive demand) the CU requirement is set 
to the structures demand / average efficiency provided in the diversion station (\*.dds) file or well station (\*.wes) file, respectively. Data can be entered 
in any order. This file is read by subroutine **`MDAINP`**.

Repeat for the number of diversion and Well only stations

Repeat for each year of the simulation
