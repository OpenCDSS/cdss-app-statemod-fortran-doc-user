# Well Station File (*.wes) #

The well station file contains information to describe the physical properties of each well structure in the system. This file is read by subroutine **`DATINP`**.

| Row-data							| Variable						| Description 								|				
| ------------------				| --------------------			| --------									|
| Station Data						| 								| 											| 
| 1									| 								| Format (a12, a24, a12, i8, f8.2, 1x, a12, 1x, f12.5) |
| 1-1								| cdividw(1)					| Well Station ID |
| 1-2								| divnamw(1)					| Well Station name |
| 1-3								| idvstaw(1)					| River node where the well is located |
| 1-4								| idivsww(1)					| Switch; 0 = off, 1 = on  |
| 1-5								| divcapw(1)					| Well capacity (cfs) |
| 1-6								| cdividyw(1)					| Daily Well Station ID (not used for monthly model) See [Section 7.17](../StandardModelingProcedures/717.md) for a detailed discussion. |
|									| 								| Enter station ID (`cdividw`) if daily data will be provided for this station. Monthly data controls. |
|									| 								| Enter another station ID to use the daily distribution of another but weight values by the monthly total in \*.wem. Monthly data controls. |
|									| 								| Enter 0 to use the average daily value from the monthly data in the \*.wem file. Monthly data controls. |
|									| 								| Enter 3 to use the daily value from the daily well demand (\*.wed) file. Daily data controls. |
|									| 								| Enter 4 use a daily pattern developed by connecting the midpoints of monthly data. Monthly data controls. |
| 1-7								| primary(1)					| Switch |
| 									| 								| 0 = off Water right priorities determine when water is diverted.  This option is commonly called SW primary because SW is typically senior. |
| 									| 								| +n = on Well water rights will be adjusted by n. This option is called GW primary because it allows priority of GW rights to be made senior to SW rights when an appropriate value of n is provided (e.g. 15000). Note StateMod operates appropriately if n makes a ground water right negative. |

| Well Switches						| 								| 											|
| 2									| 								| Format(36x, a12, 3i8, f8.2, f8.0, i8, f8.0) |
| 2-1								| idvcow2(1)					| Diversion this well structure is associated with. Enter NA if this well is not associated with a diversion structure. |
| 2-2								| idvcomw(1)					| Data type switch |
| 									| 								| 1 = monthly total demand provided ([Section 4.22](../InputDescription/422.md))
| 									| 								| 2 = not active. Reserved for annual total demand
| 									| 								| 3 = monthly irrigation water requirement provided ([Section 4.21](../InputDescription/421.md)) 
| 									| 								| 4 = not active. Reserved for annual irrigation water requirement 
| 									| 								| 5 = estimate to be zero
| 									| 								| 6 = this well station is tied to a direct diversion station and expects demand data provided as a total in file \*.ddm (e.g. no well demand data is expected)
| 2-3								| nrtnw(1)						| Number of return flow locations or table references
| 2-4								| nrtnw2(1)						| Number of depletion locations or table references
| 2-5								| divefcw(1)					| System efficiency 
|									| 								| Enter 0-100% for a constant value each month. 
|									| 								| Enter a negative value to provide 12 values, one for each month	
| 2-6								| areaw(1)						| Irrigated acreage (ac) for future
| 									| 								| n = Irrigated acreage for this structure
| 									| 								| -1 = Irrigated acreage provided in the direct diversion station file (\*.dds). Use when a structure has both SW and GW supplies.
| 2-7								| irturnw(1)					| 1 
| 2-8								| demsrcw(1)					| Demand source code (used for documentation purposes and non StateMod applications to determine if a structure supplies an irrigation demand)
| 									| 								| 1 = Irrigated acreage from GIS database
| 									| 								| 2 = Irrigated acreage from structure file (tia)
| 									| 								| 3 = Irrigated acreage from GIS database, the primary component of lands served by multiple structures
| 									| 								| 4 = Same as 3 but data is from the structure file (tia)
| 									| 								| 5 = Secondary component of lands served by multiple structures
| 									| 								| 6 = Municipal, industrial or transmountain structure (no acreage data expected)
| 									| 								| 7 = Carrier structure (no acreage data expected)
| 									| 								| 8 = Acreage data provided by the user
| 									| 								| -999 = Acreage data unknown
| | | |
| Monthly Efficiency Data			| 								| 											|
| 3									| 								| Free Format (Include if `divefc` above is < 0) |
| 3-1								| diveffw(1,12)					| Efficiency % by month for the year type selected (water year, irrigation year, calendar year) |
| | | |
| Return Flow Data					| 								| 											| 
| 4									| 								| Format (36x, a12, f8.2, i8)				|
| 4-1								| crtnidw(1)					| River node receiving return flow |
| 4-2								| pcttotw(1)					| Percent of return flow to this river node |
| 4-3								| irtndlw(1)					| Delay (return flow) table for this return flow |
