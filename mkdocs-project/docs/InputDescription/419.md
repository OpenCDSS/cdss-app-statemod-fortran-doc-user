# Direct Flow Demand Overwrite File - Monthly (*.ddo) #

The direct flow demand overwrite file contains monthly demands for each year of the study period for selected structures. This file 
allows a what if scenario to be evaluated quickly without revising the direct flow demand file. This file is read by subroutine **`MDAINP`**.
