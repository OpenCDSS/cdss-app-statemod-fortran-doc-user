# Plan or Reservoir Reuse to a T&C or Augmentation Plan Direct (ityopr=48) #

The type 48 operating rule provides a method to release water from a reservoir, recharge site or Reuse Plan to a T&C or Well Augmentation 
Plan destination (demand) via a direct release to the river. The following comments are provided:

* A “ReUse Plan” source is a special structure type that can be used to provide water supplies that might accrue from a water right transfer 
or reusable imported water. See [Section 7.14](../StandardModelingProcedures/714.md) for more details.
* A “Recharge Plan” source is a special structure type that can be used to provide water supplies that might accrue from a reservoir or canal 
seepage. 
* A “Special Augmentation” Plan source is a plan type that can be used to recognize a physical water supply is not required because of an administrative 
decision. Examples are wells located in a designated basin or decreed as non tributary.
* A “T&C” Plan destination (demand) is a special structure type that can be used to store Terms and Conditions (demands) that might be imposed on a 
water use as part of a water transfer.
* An “Augmentation” Plan destination (demand) is a plan type that can be used to store water demands imposed on a water use in order to allow a well 
to pump out of priority. 
* A “Special Augmentation” Plan destination (demand) is a plan that can be used to store water demands that can be offset by an administrative decision. 
Examples are wells located in a designated basin or decreed as non tributary.
* If the variable `OprLimit` is set to 0 no adjustment to monthly or annual diversion limits will be performed. If the variable `OprLimit` is set to -1 the 
operating rule ID specified in row 4 will have its monthly and annual diversion limits adjusted by the amount released.
* If the variable `ceuse` is set to a plan ID, any canal losses will be routed to that plan. Note the plan type must be 8 (recharge).
* Results for a type 48, Reservoir to a Plan Direct, are reported in the Stream Report (\*.xdd) as follows:
	* At the destination well plan, the diversion is reported as From River by Storage (exchange) and the Total Supply equals From River by Other. The station 
balance reports River Divert as zero because the diversion is to a plan which is non-consumptive. 
	* At the source reservoir on only carrier and Station Balance data are reported. The River Divert equals the net amount diverted at the reservoir (diversion 
less release).  If the reservoir does not store then the net amount diverted should be negative and equal to the amount released to the destination well plan 
less any losses.
