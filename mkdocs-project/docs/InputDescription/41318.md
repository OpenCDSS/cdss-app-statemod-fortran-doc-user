# Rio Grande Compact - Conejos River Direct (ityopr=18) #

The type 18 operating rule was developed specifically for the Conejos River's portion of the Rio Grande Compact. Unlike most other 
operating rules, it requires two rows of data. The first row of data expects:

* The destination to be an Instream flow (i.e. an Instream flow just below the combine Conejos River near La Sauses). 
* Source 1 is the stream gage that represents the first index flow (i.e. Conejos River near Magote). 
* Source 2 is the stream gage that represent the second index flow (i.e. Los Pinos River near Ortiz). 

The second row of data expects:

* `Qdebt` is the year when annual obligation calculations begin to include adjustments for the cumulative surplus / shortage (i.e. 1985). 
* `Qdebtx` is the initial surplus / shortage (acft) for the Conejos River (e.g. 944,000 * 40%). 
* Source 3 is the stream gage that represents the third index flow (San Antonio River at Ortiz). 
* The Source 4 coefficient is used to represent the annual yield (acft/yr) of the Closed Basin Project to the Conejos River. 
* The Source 5 coefficient is used to represent the annual discharge of the Norton Drain South to the Conejos River.

Note the format of a standard operational right input file has been adjusted to include a third source and account (coefficient).
