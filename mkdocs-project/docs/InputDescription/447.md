# Downstream Call File (*.cal) #

The downstream call file is used in conjunction with a downstream call operating rule type 23. See 
[Section 4.13.23](../InputDescription/41323.md) for a description of this operating rule. This file is typically only used for a daily application. 
Therefore, when StateMod is executed in a monthly mode the call specified on day 1 is used to represent the monthly 
call. Note that this file is currently formatted to match an example file provided by the user that requested its 
implementation. Therefore some data contained in that file (e.g. calling structure, priority date) is not used by 
StateMod. For a monthly analysis this file is read by subroutine **`MDAINP`**. For a daily analysis this file is read by 
subroutine **`DAYEST`**.
