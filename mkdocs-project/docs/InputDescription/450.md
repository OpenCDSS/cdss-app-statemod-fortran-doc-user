# Well Augmentation Plan Data File (*.plw) #

The well augmentation plan file contains information that allows a well to operate out of priority because it is tied 
to an augmentation plan. It provides data that ties a plan ID to a well water right ID and the structure served by that 
well. This file is read by subroutine **`GetPlnW`**. The following is noted:

* StateMod allows one well to be tied to more than one augmentation plan. When this occurs the well’s water right should be distributed to each augmentation plan. Typically the distribution to each augmentation plan is based on the acres served by each. This distribution limits total pumping by a well to the decreed rate.
* Because a well may be tied to more than one structure the Well Augmentation Plan file (\*.plw) is tied to both a well right and the structure served by that right. This limits that augmentation requirement for that well to the structure it serves.

Note this file uses a free format read (which is slowly being added to other parts of StateMod). Therefore Plan ID’s and Plan 
names should be provided with no spaces or in double quotes (e.g. instead of My Name enter “My Name” or My_Name).
