# Out-Of-Priority Reservoir Bookover (ityopr=8) #

The type 8 operating rule works in concert with an out-of-priority diversion (type 38) to book water:

1. From an out-of-priority reservoir account to another reservoir account or 
2. From an out-of-priority (OOP) plan to reduce its obligation. 

This rule was significantly enhanced in order to address 1. Out out-of-priority diversions in addition to out-of-priority storage and 2. Out-of-priority storage 
and diversions occurring at more than one reservoir and diversion with regard to the same subordinated reservoir. 

When the destination is a reservoir the out-of-priority diversion is typically kept in a separate account of the junior reservoir (e.g. an OOP account). Also an 
out-of-priority plan is used to track the amount taken. If the volume of water stored in the OOP plan exceeds the remaining capacity of the subordinated reservoir 
right, the Type 8 rule books water from the out-of-priority account to another general purpose account within the junior reservoir and the OOP plan obligation is 
reduced. To perform this activity the operating rule “associated” with the OOP diversion or storage being booked over must be known to the type 8 operating rule. 
If the subordinated reservoir right does not fill then a type 27 operating rule is typically used to transfer the water from the out-of-priority reservoir to the 
subordinated reservoir and adjust the obligation stored in the OOP Plan. 

When the destination is an OOP Plan the out-of-priority diversion is stored under the OOP Plan. Once the volume of water stored in the OOP plan exceeds the remaining 
capacity of the subordinated reservoir right, the obligation stored in the OOP plan is reduced. To perform this activity the operating rule “associated” with the 
OOP diversion or storage being booked over must be known to the type 8 operating rule. If the subordinated reservoir right does not fill then a type 27 operating 
rule is typically used to transfer the water from a reservoir to the subordinated reservoir and adjust the obligation stored in the OOP Plan. 

The following are noted:

* The variable `ciopso(2)` (row-data 1-10) is used to identify the senior decree that is being subordinated. 
* The variable `intern(n,1)` (rule n, value 1) is used to identify the junior decree that will be credited withdiverting water out of priority when booked over. 
* The variables `intern(n,2)` (rule n, value 2) through `intern(n,10)` (rule n, value 10) are used to identify up to 9 operating rules associated with this OOP plan.
* If the destination is a reservoir all OOP diversions are charged against the junior reservoir’s water right when they are booked over to an account where they can be released. 
* If the subordinated water right is not filled, the water stored out of priority is released to the subordinated reservoir at the end of the administration year 
assigned to each reservoir (see variable `rdate` in a reservoir station file (\*.res)).
* The type 8 operating rule has generic applications but was originally developed to handle the Blue River decree that allows OOP storage of water in Dillon Reservoir 
(an upstream junior reservoir), OOP storage of water in Blue Lake (an upstream reservoir), OOP diversion to Roberts Tunnel (an upstream junior diversion), and an OOP 
diversion to the Con Hoosier system before Green Mountain Reservoir (a downstream senior) is filled. See [Section 7.16.1](../StandardModelingProcedures/7161.md) for additional description of the Blue River Decree 
implementation to the Colorado River Basin.
