# Interruptible Supply Direct (ityopr=15) #

The type 15 operating rule allows a direct flow diversion's water right (`ciopso(2)`) to defer its ability to divert in order to supply 
water to an instream flow located downstream. The rule may or may not operate in a given year based on the flow (`iopsou(2)`) at a specified 
location (`ciopso(1)`) in the network in the month indicated when variable `imonsw(i)` is equal to 2. The following comments are provided to 
assist in using and interpreting this operating rule:

* The amount available for diversion is the minimum available to the source water right when it is in priority (i.e. diversion to instream flow = min (instream flow demand, direct diversion water right, direct diversion demand, available flow to direct diversion).
* Variable `iopsou(4,1)` allows the user to specify if the amount transferred is the total amount diverted or the amount that would have been consumed. 
* The monthly on/off switches (`imonsw(i)`) allows the operating rule to continue from one simulation year through the next (e.g. begin in August of one year and continue through October of the next year). However, this ability requires the operating rule not operate until the first on switch (`imonsw(i)` = 2) is encountered. 
* The Administration number assigned to the source water right overrides the variable `rtem(1)` provided with the operating rule. 
* Because this operating rule has the ability to turn on and off based on a discharge, this operating rule is either on or off (i.e. the user is not allowed to initiate its operation during the study period by specifying a year for variable `ioprsw(1)`.
