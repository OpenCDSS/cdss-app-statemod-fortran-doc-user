# Delay (Return Flow) Table - Monthly (*.urm) #

The monthly unit response table file contains coefficients to lag return flows. If the variable `interv` of the control file is a positive value, 
then `interv` values are expected for every pattern. If variable `interv` of the control file is a -1, then the number of values are specified for each 
pattern. Note a daily model (control file variable `iday` = 1) requires a variable number of return values be provided (variable `interv` must be negative). 
This file is read by subroutine **`MDAINP`**. 

| Row-data							| Variable						| Description 								|				
| ------------------				| --------------------			| --------									|
| Control Data						| 								| 											|
| 1 								| 								| Format (free)
| 1-1								| idly							| Delay table ID
| 1-2								| ndly(1)						| Number of entries in delay table idly
| 									| 								| Include only if variable `interv` of the control file is equal to -1
| | | |
| Delay Data | | |
| 1-3								| dlyrat(j,1)					| Delay factor for time period j
| 									| 								| Include as a percent if variable `interv` of the control file is positive or equal to -1
| 									| 								| Include as a decimal if variable `interv` of the control file is equal to -100
| Include `ndly` or `interv` delay entries | | |
| Repeat for the number of delay tables used in the diversion station file | | |
