# Historic Reservoir Content File - Monthly (*.eom) #

The historic reservoir content file (\*.eom) contains end of month reservoir content data for each year of the study period. Data should be entered in 
the order of the structure (\*.res) file. This data is only used by the Base Flow module to simulate reservoir storage and evaporation impacts on gaged 
stream flows. It is used by the report module to compare simulated results to gaged observations. This file is read by subroutine **'VIRGEN'**.
