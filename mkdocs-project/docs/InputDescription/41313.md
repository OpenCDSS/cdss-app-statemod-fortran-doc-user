# La Plata Compact (Index Flow) (ityopr=13) #

The type 13 operating rule allows an instream flow to operate based on its location on the river and the stream flow at a remote location. 
This rule has generic applications but was originally developed to handle the La Plata River compact in the San Juan River Basin. This compact, 
in general, limits Colorado's commitment to deliver water to New Mexico based on the flow at an upstream, index gage.  Additional discussion of 
the La Plata Compact implementation is provided in [Section 7.16.4](../StandardModelingProcedures/7164.md).
