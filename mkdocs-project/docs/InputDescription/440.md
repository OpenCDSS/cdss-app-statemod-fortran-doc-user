# Reservoir Target Content File - Daily (*.tad) #

The daily reservoir target file contains reservoir targets or a daily pattern for each day of the simulation period. Data should be entered 
in the order of the structure (\*.res) file. To simplify the preparation of daily data, StateMod allows the user to provide daily data or a 
pattern to be used with monthly data. When the reservoir station variable `cresidy` is set to 3 the reservoir station variable `cresid` is used 
to indicate daily data controls and any monthly data provided in the monthly direct flow demand file (\*.tar) is ignored. When the reservoir 
station variable `cresidy` is set to any ID including its own (`cresid`) StateMod uses daily data as a pattern to estimate daily data from monthly 
data using the same approach described under daily streamflow data ([Section 4.36](../InputDescription/436.md)).

This file only required if the model is operated in a daily mode. Data can be entered with stations entered in any order. This file is read by 
subroutine **`DAYDATA`**.
