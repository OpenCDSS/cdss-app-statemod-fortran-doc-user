# Reservoir Re Diversion (ityopr=30) #

The type 30 operating right allows a reservoir to re-divert water released in the same time step to a T&C plan by another operating rule. 
This operating rule is similar to a standard reservoir diversion except the amount diverted is limited to the amount released by a prior 
operating rule (`ciopso1`).This rule was developed and is commonly used because T&C releases are typically required to benefit other users before 
the system knows a release was unnecessary. Therefore, when implemented properly, the senior administration number of the T&C release operates 
and makes water available to other water users. Then the junior reservoir re diversion (type 30) operates to try and re-store this release if 
water is available (e.g. the release was not required).
