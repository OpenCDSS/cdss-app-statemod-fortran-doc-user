# Instream Flow Right File (*.ifr) #

The instream flow right file contains data associated with an instream flowâ€™s water rights. Note that StateMod allows two more more instream flow rights for one reach. This file is read by subroutine **`RIGINP`**.

| ------------------				| --------------------			| --------									|
| Right Data						| 								| 											|
| 1 								| 								| Format (a12, a24,a12, 4x, f12.0, f8.2, i8) |
| 1-1 								| cifrri 						| Instream Flow right ID |
| 1-2 								| namei(1) 						| Instream Flow right name |
| 1-3 								| cgoto 						| Instream structure ID associated with this right |
| 1-3 								| irtem(1) 						| Administration number |
