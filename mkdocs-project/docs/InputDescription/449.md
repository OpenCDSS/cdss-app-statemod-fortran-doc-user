# Plan Data File (*.pln) #

The plan station file contains information related to operating a term and condition, well augmentation and reuse 
plan. It provides data related to the plan including its ID, name, location on the river system, etc. If return flow 
data is specified for a plan it is provided in the Plan Return File (\*.prf). [Section 7.8](../StandardModelingProcedures/78.md) provides 
additional discussion of a plan and their use.  

Note that plan efficiency and plan return data can be provided for any plan type, however this information is only used by StateMod 
for T&C plans (Type 1), Well Augmentation plans (Type 2), and Reuse plans (Types 3 and 4).

* The variable `ipeff(1)` allows the user to provide either a constant or 12 efficiency values to be used for individual months. If a constant value is provided, it is equal to the value provided with the source structure in the diversion station file (\*.dds).
* The variable `iprf(1)` allows the user to provide either a constant or 12 return flow values to be used for individual months. If a constant value is provided, it is equal to the value provided with the source structure in the diversion station file (\*.dds).

Note this file uses a free format read (which is slowly being added to other parts of StateMod). Therefore Plan ID’s and Plan 
names should be provided with no spaces or in double quotes (e.g. instead of My Name enter “My Name” or My_Name). This file is 
read by subroutine **`GETPLN`**.
