# Response File (*.rsp) #

The response file contains the names of all other data files required to run the model. This file is read by subroutine **`StateM`**. Note, that Version 10.30 
and greater allows a user to enter response file data using one of two formats; random and sequential. StateMod reads the first file type and based on the 
occurrence of the character `=` in the first file name it determines if the file is random (contains a `=`) or sequential (does not contain a `=`).

The random file approach allows file names to be entered in any order as described below under Random Response Format. Any file type that is not required 
for a simulation is simply not included. Also any file name may be commented out by including a `#` character in column 1. Its format is described in the 
table below (Random Response Format). For a description of the sequential, old, format see the section [9.0 Discontinued but Supported File Formats](../Discontinued/91.md). 

Note that model output files takes on the name of the response (\*.rsp) file; the user is encouraged to manage different model runs using descriptive response 
file naming conventions.
