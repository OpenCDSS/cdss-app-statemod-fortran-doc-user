# Augmentation Well Direct (ityopr=37) #

The type 37 operating rule provides a method to pump an Augmentation well in order to satisfy a T&C or Augmentation Plan demand. The source 
is a well water right. The destination is a T&C or Well Augmentation Plan. The following comments are provided to assist in using and interpreting 
this rule:

* An augmentation well right is typically tied to a unique (augmentation) well structure. This allows unique return and depletion data associated 
with the augmentation well to be provided in the well station file (\*.wes). Note that return flows associated with an augmentation are typically 
assigned a unit response function that routes water to the stream in the same time step that they occur.
* This rule requires source 2 (`ciopso(2)`) be an “Augmentation plan ID”. This allows the augmentation plan requirements associated with the augmentation 
well to be stored and ultimately satisfied. This plan ID may or may not be the same as the destination plan ID. 
* An augmentation well might serve as both a water supply and an augmentation source. This can occur when the same right is assigned to both a standard 
(irrigation) well structure and an Augmentation well structure. If the administration number assigned in the operational right file is different than the 
administration number of the source (augmentation) well the operating rule value is used and a warning is printed to the log file. The amount pumped to 
each demand is limited by the well’s total capacity and water right.
