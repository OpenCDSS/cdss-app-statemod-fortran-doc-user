# Accounting Plan Limit (ityopr=47) #

The type 47 operating rule provides a method to impose monthly and annual limits for one or more operating rules. It is typically used when the 
source of the water supply is a “standard” storage right. For example if water is stored in a reservoir under a “standard” storage right, releases 
to selected users might be limited to the monthly and annual limits imposed by this rule. This rule has generic application but was developed for 
the Colorado River Basin where replacement reservoir releases from Green Mountain Reservoir, Williams Fork Reservoir and Wolford Mountain Reservoir 
are limited to 66,000 af/yr. The Accounting Plan assigned as the source in this rule is typically tied to a Replacement Reservoir Release (type 10) 
or a Direct Flow Release with a Plan (type 27). The following are noted:

* The operating rule’s source is an accounting plan that requires a monthly or annual limit. It can be located anywhere in the network.
* The operating rule’s destination is null (i.e. the rule simply imposes monthly or annual limits on any water user tied to this plan).
* The administration number specified for this plan is not used by StateMod (i.e. it is simply a place holder). 
* The annual limits are reset at the month that corresponds to the source variable `iopsou(2,k)`. For example 1 = January, 2 = February, etc.)
* Monthly and annual data is required for this operating rule.
