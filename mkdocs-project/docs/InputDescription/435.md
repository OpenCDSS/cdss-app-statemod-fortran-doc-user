# Output Request (*.out) #

The output request file contains data which will limit the extent of selected output file requests. Note, the first two rows of data (variables `ftype` and `parameter`) 
are only used by the special printout request (\*.xsp). Rows 3 through n contain reference data for the structure(s) to be printed and are used by the standard 
printout reports (\*.xdd, \*.xre, \*.xir, \*.xwe and \*.xop). To eliminate the need to type an output request file, one is automatically generated by the check 
option (`-check`) for every type of structure in the system. Note the default name for that file is \*.xou. It is commonly renamed to \*.out and referenced as such 
in the response file to avoid it being overwritten whenever a new check run is made. Also the structures to be printed by that file default to print nodes where 
inflow occurs (FLO) and not print other types of nodes (DIV, RES, ISF, WEL, OTH).
