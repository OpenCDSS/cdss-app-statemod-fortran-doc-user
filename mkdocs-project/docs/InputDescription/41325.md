# Direct Flow Bypass Direct (ityopr=25) #

The type 25 operating rule allows a direct flow diversion's water right (`ciopso(1)`) to be bypassed to a direct flow structure, reservoir or plan (`ciopde`). 
The diversion can occur from the river or through a carrier. The amount diverted may be limited to the amount available (Diversion) or its CU (Depletion). 
The following comments are provided to assist in using and interpreting this operating rule:

* A water right may operate as both a standard direct flow right and as a bypass water right. 
* The user can supply data that limits the bypass to a percent (ownership) of the water right.
* The user can supply data that limits the bypass to the consumptive use of their portion of the water right. The efficiency of water use is estimated to 
equal the efficiency of the source water right’s structure.
* The source water right may be transferred to a diversion, reservoir or plan (`ciopde`). When the destination is a plan, the user is typically trying to satisfy 
a T&C Plan obligation generated by another operating rule with the source water right.
* The user can supply a “Reuse plan” (`creuse`) that allows consumptive use credits associated with the direct flow bypass to be stored. A “Reuse Plan” may not 
be assigned when the destination is a plan because it using the full transfer to offset a T&C requirement.
* Because a direct flow bypass right may be used to serve both a direct flow right and as a direct flow bypass right, the administration number assigned to the 
operating rule is used in the analysis analysis for both the direct flow and the direct flow bypass  (i.e. it is not overridden by the source water rights 
administration number). 
* Direct flow bypass operations may be controlled over a season by using appropriate demand data and/or the monthly on/off switch (`imonsw(im)`). Note the monthly 
on/off switches only control the bypass operation (i.e. the source water right continues to operate independent of the monthly on/off switch).
* Monthly and Annual exchange limits are required as input.
* The amount available for diversion is the minimum physical water available, remaining decree of the exchanging right (e.g. some of the decree may have been used 
for direct diversion purposes), the bypass potential between the destination and bypass location, and the destination structure’s capacity and the destination 
structure’s demand. 
* Carrier losses associated with intervening structures may be provided if variable `OprLoss` is > 0 or = -1 and the variable `dumx` = 1-10 or < -12. Note carrier 
losses are routed back to the system using the return flow parameters associated with the carrier structure. 
* Terms and Conditions (T&C Plans) may be calculated if the source 2 variable (`ciopso2`) is set to a T&C plan. The variable `iousou(4,1)` is used to indicate how 
and when T&C demands are calculated.
	* If the user is implementing T&C on a changed water right, it is recommended the user implement Changed Water Rights plan operations (See [Section 7.11](../StandardModelingProcedures/711.md) 
	and [Section 4.13.26](../InputDescription/41326.md)) and associate the T&C plan when the water is released from the Changed Water Rights plan.
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = -1 the destination must be an accounting plan and the T&C Obligation is calculated when water is released from that 
	Accounting plan using a type 27 or 28 rule.
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = 1 a standard return pattern is used to calculate the T&C Obligation. A Standard Return Pattern calculates the T&C 
	Obligation to be:
		* \\(\text{T&C Obligation (standard)} = (\text{Data in the return flow file (\*.urm)}) \times ((\text{Released Water}) \times (1.0 - \text{CU Factor}))\\) where the CU Factor is provided in row 5. The 
		first value in a standard return flow table corresponds to the month diverted, the second to the month after a diversion, etc. Data that associates a Plan ID 
		with any number of Return Flow Location(s), Percent(s), and Return Table ID(s) is provided in the plan Return File (\*.prf).
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = 2 a fixed return pattern is used to calculate the T&C Obligation. A Fixed Return Pattern calculates the T&C Obligation to be:
		* \\(\text{T&C Obligation (fixed)} = (\text{Data in the return flow file (\*.urm)}) \times (\text{Released Water})\\) The first value in a fixed return flow table corresponds to the first 
		month in the simulation (e.g. January for a calendar year simulation), the second month to February (again for a calendar year simulation), etc. Data that associates 
		a Plan ID with any number of Return Flow Location(s), Percent(s), and Return Table ID(s) is provided in the plan Return File (\*.prf).
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = 3 a mixed return pattern is used to calculate the T&C Obligation. Mixed Return Pattern contains both a Standard and Fixed 
	component and calculates the T&C Obligation to be:
		* \\(\text{T&C Obligation (standard)} = (\text{Data in the return flow file (\*.urm)}) \times ((\text{Released Water}) \times (1.0-\text{CU Factor}))\\) where the CU Factor is provided in row 5. The 
		first value in a standard return flow table corresponds to the month diverted, the second to the month after a diversion, etc. Data that associates a Plan ID with 
		any number of Return Flow Location(s), Percent(s), and Return Table ID(s) is provided in the plan Return File (\*.prf).
		* \\(\text{T&C Obligation (fixed)} = (\text{Data in the return flow file (\*.urm)}) \times (\text{Released Water})\\) The first value in a fixed return flow table corresponds to the first 
		month in the simulation (e.g. January for a calendar year simulation), the second month to February (again for a calendar year simulation), etc. Data that associates 
		a Plan ID with any number of Return Flow Location(s), Percent(s), and Return Table ID(s) is provided in the plan Return File (\*.prf).
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = 4 a default return pattern is used to calculate the T&C Obligation. A Default Return Pattern has a standard component that uses 
	historic return flow data associated with the source water right to calculate the T&C Obligation. 
	* If the variable `ciopso2` is set to a T&C Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` is greater than zero then CU Factors are expected to be provided in card 5. Note the CU Factors typically 
	represent negotiated values related to, but not necessarily the same as, the efficiency of the Transfer From Structure. Also these factors are only used when `iopsou(4,1)` 
	= 1 (Standard Return) or 3 (Mixed Return) even though they are required as input.
* Water bypassed by a Type 25 operating rule is reported in the Stream Report (\*.xdd) as follows:
	* At the source, the water bypassed to the destination is reported as Carried, Exchanged or Bypassed.  
	* At the destination, the water diverted is reported as From River by Other.
