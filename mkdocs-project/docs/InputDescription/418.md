# Direct Flow Demand File - Annual (*.dda) #

The annual direct flow demand file contains twelve constant demands which are repeated for each year of the study period. Annual data is 
required when the diversion station variable `idvcom` is set to 2 (annual total demand) or 4 (annual irrigation water requirement). Data should 
be entered in the order of the structure file (\*.dds). This file is read by subroutine **`MDAINP`**.
