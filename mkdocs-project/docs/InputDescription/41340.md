# South Platte Compact Release (ityopr=40) #

For a complete description of how the South Platte compact is implemented in StateMod see [Section 7.16.3](../StandardModelingProcedures/7163.md). The Type 40 operating rule simulates a 
release from the South Platte Compact Plan.  It should be used to allow any diversion not located in water district 64 (e.g. upstream of the 
Washington county line) to attempt to divert water stored in the South Platte Compact plan and therefore not be called out by the compact.   

In addition, it should be used to release water from the compact plan to the compact itself.  The following comments are provided:

* To serve any diversion that is water short and not located in water district 64 the **destination should be assigned 64x**.
* When the destination is any diversion not located in water district 64 (e.g 64x) the administration number assigned is not used since this 
operating rule is called immediately following the priority of any water right that is water short and not located in water district 64.  
* To serve the compact itself the destination should be assigned an instream flow that represents the South Platte Compact.
* The administration number assigned to the operating rule used to release water from the South Platte Compact to the compact itself should 
be the most junior in the basin. 
* Results for a type 40, South Platte Compact Storage, are reported in the Stream Report (\*.xdd) as follows:
	* When the destination is any structure not located in water district 64, the diversion is reported as From River by Other because it is 
diverted by an operating rule.  The Total Supply equals From River by Other that also equals Water Use To Other.  In the Station Balance accounting 
River Outlfow equals the River Inflow less River Divert and River by Well.
	* When the destination is the South Platte Compact, the diversion is reported as From River by Other because it is diverted by an operating rule.  
The Total Supply equals From River by Other that also equals Water Use To Other.  In the Station In/Out accounting the return flow equals the divesion 
because it is non-consumptive.  In the Station Balance accounting River Outlfow equals the River Inflow less River Divert and River by Well.
* The check file contains a list of every structure served by a type 40 operating rule.
