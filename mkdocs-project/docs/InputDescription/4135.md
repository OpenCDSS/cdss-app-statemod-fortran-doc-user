# Reservoir Storage by Exchange (ityopr=5) #
The type 5 operating rule allows a reservoir to store water by an exchange with another reservoir. When the destination reservoir 
variable `ciopde` (row-data = 1-6) is a reservoir ID, the exchange is not constrained by the reservoirâ€™s water rights. When the variable 
`ciopde` (row-data = 1-6) is a water right, the exchange is limited to the water right specified less any diversions that have been charged 
to that right during the administrative season.
