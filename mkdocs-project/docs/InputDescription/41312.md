# Reoperation (ityopr=12) #

The type 12 operating rule provides a method to speed up model execution while incurring some level of inaccuracy. It is typically used in coordination 
with the control file variable `ireopx`. When the control file variable `ireopx` is set to 0, all activities that supply new water to the system (reservoir 
releases, return flows to non downstream tributaries, etc.) automatically cause the model to reoperate with no inaccuracy and this operating rule is not 
required. When the control file variable `ireopx` is set to 1, this operating rule initiates reoperation at the Administration number specified. Reoperation, 
as used herein, restarts the water right allocation procedure from senior to junior in order to allow senior ditches to benefit from any new water that might 
have been introduced to the system.
