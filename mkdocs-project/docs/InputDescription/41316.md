# Direct Flow Storage Direct (ityopr=16) #

The type 16 operating rule allows a direct flow diversion's water right (`ciopso(1)`) to store in account (`iopdes(2,1)` of reservoir (`ciopde`). The amount 
stored may be limited by a maximum exchange percent (`iopsou(4,1)`); which is the same as 100 - a bypass percent. The following comments are provided to assist 
in using and interpreting this operating rule:

* A water right may operate as a standard direct flow right and/or as a direct flow storage right. When the variable `iopsou(2,1)` = 0 is the right is 
used as a direct flow storage right only. When the variable `iopsou(2,1)` = 1 is the right is used as both a direct flow right and a direct flow storage right. 
* The source water right must be associated with 1 user (i.e. multiple users at the same diversion are not supported). 
* Because a direct flow storage right may be used to serve both a direct flow storage user and as a direct flow storage right, the Administration number 
assigned to the operating rule is used in the analysis (i.e. it is not overridden by the source water rights administration number). 
* Variable `iopsou(4,1)` allows the user to specify the maximum percent of the remaining decree that may be stored. This maximum percent is equivalent 
to 100 - a bypass percent. 
* Direct flow storage is limited to the irrigation season by evaluating the demand associated with the structure tied to the source water right in the 
direct flow demand file (\*.ddm). In addition, the user may control seasonal demands using the monthly on/off switch (`imonsw(i)`). 
* The amount available for diversion is the minimum physical water available, remaining decree (e.g. some of the decree may have been used for direct 
diversion purposes), the exchange potential between the direct flow right and the reservoir, the maximum direct flow storage percent, the remaining reservoir 
volume, the reservoir target, the remaining reservoir account volume.
