# Reservoir to Reservoir Transfer (Bookover) (ityopr=6) #

The type 6 operating rule allows a reservoir to reservoir bookover to occur. It is commonly used to transfer water from one reservoir 
storage account to another in a particular month. In addition, the amount booked over may be constrained by a diversion demand or the 
amount diverted by another operating rule.  

The following are noted:

* If variable `iopsou(2,1)` is set to a diversion structure, variable `iopsou(4)` is set to 99 and variable `oprlimit` is set to 0, the book over 
can be limited by the demand specified in the direct diversion demand file (\*.ddm).
* If variable `iopsou(2,1)` is set to a operating rule, variable `iopsou(4)` is set to 0, and variable `oprlimit` is set to 0, the book over can 
be limited by the amount divered by another operating rule.
* If variable `iopsou(2,1)` is set to a operating rule, `iopsou(4)` is set to 0 and `oprlimit` is set to 1, the bookover can be limited to not 
occur after the operating rule `iopsou(2,1)` operates.  This capability was added for several reservoirs located in the San Juan Basin where water 
needs to get booked from several accounts in a reservoir to an account in that same reservoir then booked back from that account in order to 
reallocate total reservoir storage to each individual account at the beginning of the reservoirâ€™s administration year. 

A Bookover is reported in the reservoir report (\*.xre) as follows:

* When a Type 6 Bookover operating rule is used to book water from one reservoir account to another without making a release to the river, 
the reservoir report (\*.xwb) for the total reservoir (account 0) and the account where the water was booked shows the water under the column 
7, `From Carrier by Other`.   In addition, the reservoir report (\*.xwb) for the individual account along with the operating rule reporting 
(\*.xop) reflect the actual amount diverted.
* When a Type 6 Bookover operating rule is used to book water from one account to another and then back at the same reservoir, the reservoir 
report (\*.xwb) for the total reservoir (account 0) shows the water moving twice (once out and once back in) under the column 7, `From Carrier by Other`. 
However, the reservoir report (\*.xwb) for the individual accounts along with the operating rule reporting (\*.xop) reflect the actual amount diverted.
* See [Section 7.5](../StandardModelingProcedures/75.md) for additional discussion on modeling reservoir operations, including bookovers.
