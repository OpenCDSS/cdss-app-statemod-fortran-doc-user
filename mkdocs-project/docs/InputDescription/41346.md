# Multiple Plan Ownership (ityopr=46) #

The type 46 operating rule provides a method to distribute water from one accounting plan to multiple accounting plans at the same priority. It is 
typically used along with a Direct Flow Exchange (type 24) or Direct Flow Bypass (type 25) when the transferred water is used by more than one owner. 
The following are noted:

* The source is an accounting plan for which the water supply is typically a water transfer associated with a Direct Flow Exchange (type 24) or Direct 
Flow Bypass (type 25).
* The destination is two or more accounting plans. Each plan represents the percent ownership of the transferred water from the original accounting plan. 
Each should be located downstream of the source account.
* After the water is distributed via the Type 46 rule, water is typically released from the destination plans using an Admin Plan Direct Release (type 27), 
or an Admin Plan Exchange (type 28), or an Admin Plan Spill (type 29).
* The percent ownership is specified using variable `iopdes(2,k)` as a percent.
* The maximum number of owners is set at 10.
