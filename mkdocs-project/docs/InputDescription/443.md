# Historic Streamflow File - Daily (*.riy) #

The daily historic streamflow file contains streamflows or a daily pattern for each day of the simulation period. 
To simplify the preparation of daily data, StateMod allows the user to provide daily data or a pattern to be used 
with monthly data. When the river station variable `crunidy` is set to 3 the river station variable `crunid` is used to 
indicate daily data controls and any monthly data provided in the monthly historic streamflow file (\*.rih) is ignored. 
When the river station variable `crunidy` is set to any ID including its own (`crunid`) StateMod uses daily data as a pattern 
to estimate daily data using the same approach described under daily streamflow data ([Section 4.36](../InputDescription/436.md)).

This file is only required if the model is operated in a daily baseflow mode. Data can be entered with stations entered 
in any order. This file is read by subroutine **`DAYDATA`**.
