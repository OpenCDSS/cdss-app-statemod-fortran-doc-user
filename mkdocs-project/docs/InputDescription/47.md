# Instream Flow Station File (*.ifs) #

The instream flow station file contains information to describe the physical properties of each instream flow in the system. This file is read by subroutine **`DATINP`**.

| Row-data							| Variable						| Description 								|				
| ------------------				| --------------------			| --------									|
| Station Data						| 								| 											| 
| 1 								|								| Format (a12, a24, a12, 1x, a12,1x,a12,i8) |
| 1-1 								| cifrid(1) 					| Instream flow station ID					|
| 1-2 								| xfrnam1(i,1) 					| Instream flow station name				|
| 1-3 								| cgoto(1) 						| Upstream river node where the instream flow point or reach is located |
| 1-4 								| ifrrsw(1) 					| Switch; 0 = off, 1 = on |
| 1-5 								| crtnid 						| Downstream river node where the instream flow point or reach is located. For an instream point enter `cgoto(1)` or leave blank |
| 1-6 								| cifrridy(1) 					| Daily Instream station ID (for daily model only). See [Section 7.17](../StandardModelingProcedures/717.md) for a detailed discussion. |
|									| 								| Enter Instream station ID (`crunid`) if daily data will be provided for this station. Monthly data controls. 
| 									| 								| Enter another instream station ID to use the daily distribution of another but weight values by the monthly total in \*.rim file |
|									| 								| Enter 0 to use the average daily value from the monthly data in the \*.ifm file. Monthly data controls.
|									| 								| Enter 3 to use the daily value from the daily demand (\*.ifd) file. Daily data controls.
|									| 								| Enter 4 use a daily pattern developed by connecting the midpoints of monthly data. Monthly data controls.
| 1-7 								| iifcom(1) 					| Data type switch |
| 									| 								| 1 = monthly total demand provided [(Section 4.17)](../InputDescription/417.md) |
| 									| 								| 2 = annual total demand provided [(Section 4.18)](../InputDescription/418.md) |

Repeat for the number of instream flow stations
