# General Replacement Reservoir to a Diversion by a Direct Release or Exchange (ityopr=10) #

The type 10 operating rule provides a method to supply reservoir water to a large number of structures without supplying individual operating rules 
for each. The following are noted:

* The operating rule checks whether reservoir replacement water will be supplied to a diversion by a direct reservoir release or exchange. 
* The operating rule serves all water rights which are senior to its Administration number which have variable `ireptyp` of the Direct Diversion 
Station File (\*.dds) set to 1 or -1. 
* The variable `ireptyp` specified by structure in the diversion station (\*.dds) file specifies if replacement releases are to be made for the 
full diversion (`ireptyp` = 1) or depletion (`ireptyp` = -1) or not at all (`ireptyp` = 0).
* When more than one replacement reservoir is specified, they are sorted by Administration number and operate by priority, most senior first. 
* The replacement reservoir operating rule applies to direct flow structures only, therefore carrier systems must be tied to a replacement reservoir 
directly. The following are noted:
	* The replacement reservoir operating rule has generic applications but was originally developed to handle the replacement reservoir obligations of Green 
Mountain Reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. 
	* When a replacement reservoir operating rule is included in a simulation and the release from a replacement reservoir is non-zero, additional information 
associated with the replacement reservoir operation is provided in the replacement reservoir summary (\*.xrp).
