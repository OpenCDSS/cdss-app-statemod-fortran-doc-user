# Seasonal (Daily) Water Right Direct (ityopr=36) #

The type 36 operating rule provides a method to limit a direct flow water right to begin on a particular day and end on a particular day 
during a monthly simulation. In addition it may be used in a daily analysis if a diversion has several water rights, with some controlled 
by their daily demand and others limited to both their daily demand data and a specified diversion season. The type 36 operating right has 
generic applications, however it was originally developed to model Meadow Rights that occur in water districts 1 and 64 of the South Platte 
River.
