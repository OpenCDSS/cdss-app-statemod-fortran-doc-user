# Diversion by a Carrier by Exchange (ityopr=7) #

The type 7 operating rule provides a method to allow a diversion by a carrier via a reservoir exchange. In general, an exchange is 
required whenever a reservoir cannot serve a demand directly. This operating rule implicitly limits the exchange amount to ensure 
no senior, intervening water rights are impacted. Intervening rights are those water rights that occur between the storing reservoir 
and a point downstream where the releasing reservoir's water is available.

| 1-2								| nameo(1)						| Operational right name
| 1-3								| rtem(1)						| Administration number
| 1-4								| dumx							| Monthly Switch 
| 									| 								| 0 = No monthly on/off values
| 									| 								| 12 = Number of monthly on/off switches provided
| 1-5								| ioprsw(1)						| Annual On/Off Switch 
| 									| 								| 0 = off 
| 									| 								| 1 = on
| 									| 								| +n = Begin in year n
| 									| 								| -n = Stop after year n 
| | | |
| Destination Data | | |
| 1-6								| ciopde						| Destination - Operational Right ID of the Carrier
| 1-7								| iopdes(2,1)					| Destination account
| 									| 								| For a diversion destination, enter 1
| 									| 								| For a reservoir destination, enter 
| 									| 								| +n Account to be served by this right
| 									| 								| -n Fill the first n accounts based on the ratio of their ownership
| | | |
| Supply Data | | |
| 1-8								| ciopso(1)						| Supply reservoir ID
| 1-9								| iopsou(2,1)					| Supply reservoir account
| 1-10								| ciopso(2)						| 0
| 1-11								| iopsou(4,1)					| See [Section 7.4.6](../StandardModelingProcedures/746.md) for a discussion of the reservoir demand options.
| 									| 								| 0 = reservoir demand is not adjusted
| 									| 								| +n = Reservoir demand is limited to not exceed CIR/n; where n (%) is the efficiency of reservoir water use. Note n (%) is limited to not exceed the max system efficiency. Also a +n requires the variable efficiency option (ieffmax) from control file be on.
