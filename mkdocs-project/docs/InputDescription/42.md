# Control File (*.ctl) #

The control file contains information which controls the model simulation. To allow old StateMod data sets to operate without editing, the data 
after the year type (row 18-1) is assumed to be zero if not provided. Comments, indicated by a `#` in column 1, may be provided at any location in 
this file. This file is read by subroutine **`DATINP`**.
