# Reservoir or Plan Spill (ityopr=29) #

The type 29 operating rule provides a method to spill water from a Reservoir or Reuse Plan or Accounting Plan or a Changed Water Right Plan to the 
system. The following are noted:

* When water is spilled from a plan it must be a Reuse Plan, an Accounting Plan or a Changed Water Right Plan.  
	* A “ReUse Plan” is a special structure type that can be used identify the location of a reusable water supply associated with a CU transfer or 
transmountain import (see [Section 7.8](../StandardModelingProcedures/78.md) for more details about plans). 
	* An “Accounting Plan” is a special structure type that can be used to identify the location of transferred water that might be used for a variety 
of demands (see [Section 7.8](../StandardModelingProcedures/78.md) for more details about plans). 
	* A “Changed Water Right Plan” is a special structure that can be used to temporarily store a changed water right at its decreed priority and released 
at a priority that is junior by a direct release using a type 27 operating rule or by exchange using a type 28 operating rule or spilled using a type 29 
operating rule (see [Section 7.11](../StandardModelingProcedures/711.md) for more details about a Changed Water Right plan).  
* If the reuse plan is tied to a reservoir (e.g. it is a plan type 3 or 5) then source 1 (`ciopso(1)`) should be a reservoir ID and source 2 (`ciopso(2)`) 
may or may not be a Plan ID. 
* If the reuse plan is not tied to a reservoir then source 1 (`ciopso(1)`) should be a plan ID and source 2 (`ciopso(2)`) should be NA. 
* If the variable `OprLimit` is set to 1 the operating rule ID specified in row 4 will have its monthly and annual limits increased by the amount released.
* If the source is an Changed Water Right plan then the destination (`ciopde`) should be the location of the source water right.
* The type 29 operating rule allows the source to be a reservoir that may or may not be associated with a plan.  As opposed to a standard reservoir spill 
operating rule (type 9) that releases water from a reservoir to meet a target storage, a  type 29 reservoir spills the amount currently in storage when the 
operating rule executes (e.g. it releases without regard to the target storage).   
* The variable `ciopde` allows the user to specify where a spill will occur.  The following are recommended:
	* If a plan is specified, with or without a reservoir, the user has the ability to control if the available flow at the node where the reservoir is located 
does or does not get adjusted.  This capability is often required for a Changed Water Right Plan where the water may be diverted, temporarily stored in a plan 
that subsequently gets spilt for temporary storage in other plans associated with multiple users and ultimately released.  If simulating a changed water right, 
the spill location, variable `ciopde`, should be the location of the changed water right.
	* If a plan is not specified, e.g. water is being spilled from a reservoir for an administrative purpose, the spill will occur at the reservoir node and the 
River Outflow and Available Flow are adjusted using the same approach as a type 9 operating rule. If the source is a reservoir the spill location, variable `ciopde`, 
should be NA since the reservoir location is the default spill location.
