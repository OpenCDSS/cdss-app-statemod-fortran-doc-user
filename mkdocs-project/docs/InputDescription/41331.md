# Carrier Right with Reuse (ityopr=31) #

The type 31 operating rule provides a method to divert water to a reservoir or direct flow structure using another structure’s water rights. 
It is similar to the type 11 operating rule except it tracks reusable water associated with the diverted water’s return flows. Water may be 
diverted to a reservoir or direct flow structure using a carrier structure’s water rights. In addition, it can be used to constrain a diversion 
to the capacity of up to 10 intervening structures. 

Note a diversion is implicitly constrained by the capacity of the destination structure (variable `ciopde` 1-6). Also, if several operating rules 
use the same water right, diversions are not allowed to exceed the decreed capacity. Finally if the destination is a reservoir, the operating rule 
demand is the destination reservoir’s capacity. If the destination is a diversion, the demand is the destination structure's demand.
