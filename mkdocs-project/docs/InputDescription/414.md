# Precipitation File - Monthly (\*.prc) or Annual (\*.pra) #

The evaporation file contains total monthly (12 values per simulation year) or annual (12 average values for every year) evaporation data. The type 
of data provided is controlled by the variable `moneva` from the control file. This file is read by subroutine **`MDAINP`**.
