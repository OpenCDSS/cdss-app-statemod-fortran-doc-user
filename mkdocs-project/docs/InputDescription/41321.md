# Wells with Sprinkler Use (ityopr=21) #

The type 21 operating rule allows the administration date for wells with sprinklers to be different than that specified by the well water 
rights (\*.wer) file. This operating rule is commonly applied to simulate maximum water supply mode which preferentially meets a structures 
demand by wells with sprinklers first, surface water second and wells with flood irrigation last. Note this operating rule expects, and checks, 
that the control file (\*.ctl) variables `itsfile`, `ieffmax` and `isprnk` are set appropriately. As described in [Section 4.2](../InputDescription/42.md), the control variable 
`itsfile` provides sprinkler area, sprinkler efficiency and `gwmode` data; the control variable `ieffmax` provides flood efficiency data; and the 
variable `isprnk` specifies sprinklers will be used. Note the irrigation practice time series file (\*.ipy) variable `gwmode` must equal 1 
(maximum supply) in order for this operating rule to apply.
