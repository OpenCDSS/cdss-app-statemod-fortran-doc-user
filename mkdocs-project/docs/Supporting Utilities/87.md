# SmNewRsp StateMod Response #

The StateMod Response File preprocessor (`SmNewRsp`) allows a discontinued StateMod response file to be read and a new StateMod file constructed 
that is consistent with the Version 10.30 update that allows files to be provide in any order using a file descriptor. As presented below `SmNewRsp` 
keys on the suffix recommended and typically used in an existing StateMod response file to build a control file that is consistent with version 10.30 
and greater. Note that if any existing file that does not contain a standard, recommended name `SmNewRsp` will warn the user but will not try to 
determine the file type. Also, since the new response file format was adopted with version 10.30, any files added after that time (e.g. Plans, 
Reservoir Return Data, etc.) are not processed. Similar to files with a non-standard suffix, `SmNewRsp` will warn the user but will not try to determine 
the file type. When a warning is encountered, the output from `SmNewRsp` will typically require hand editing before they can be successfully used by 
StateMod.

To execute `SmNewName` the user simply types: `SmNewName flname.rsp` where `flname.rsp` is an old sequential StateMod response. The new random response 
file is named `SmNewRsp.out`. Also execution notes and warnings are reported in file named `SmNewRsp.log`.

**Files processed by SmNewRsp (those in existence before version 10.30)**
