# Direct Reservoir Release as an Augmentation Supply  #

StateMod allows augmentation requirements to be met by reservoir releases either directly or via exchange. This 
operation generally occurs when a portion of the reservoir water right is decreed for augmentation, among other uses, 
and the reservoir can release to meet remaining augmentation requirements.  The approach below assumes the reservoir 
is already included in the model; see the [Add a Reservoir](../StandardModelingProcedures/743.md) section for more 
information on adding a reservoir to the model.

1. In the operating rule (\*.opr) file, include a Plan/Reservoir Reuse to Plan by Direct or Exchange (Type 48 and 49) 
operating rule in order to release water from a reservoir to offset an augmentation requirement.  
	* The source in this rule is the reservoir and the destination is the augmentation plan; use more than one operating 
	rule to release from more than one account.
2. Review the plan summary (\*.xpl) file, operating rule summary (\*.xop), and reservoir summary (\*.xre) file for the 
release amount used to offset the augmentation requirement.
