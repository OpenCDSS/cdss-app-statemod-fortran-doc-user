# Add/Change a Water Right Priority or Amount #

1.	For direct flow rights: Edit the diversion right file (\*.ddr) using the StateDMI commands; use set 
commands to add a water right or overwrite the water right amount or priority for an existing right. 
2.	For reservoir rights: Edit the reservoir right file (\*.rer) using the StateDMI commands; use set commands 
to add a water right, overwrite the water right amount or priority for an existing right, or change the accounts 
that can be filled by that water right.
3.	For instream flow rights: Edit the instream flow right file (\*.ifr) using the StateDMI commands; use set 
commands to add a water right or overwrite the water right amount or priority for an existing right. 
4.	Confirm the revised water rights files (\*.ddr, \*.rer, \*.ifr) are reflected in the response file (\*.rsp) 
and simulate the model.
