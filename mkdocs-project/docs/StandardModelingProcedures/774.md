# How to Implement the Maximum or Mutual Supply Approaches #

StateMod allows the user to simulate wells using a Maximum or Mutual water supply 
approach. Both require an irrigation parameter (\*.ipy) file be provided that contains 
total ground water acreage, sprinkler acreage, efficiency data, and water use approach 
parameter (`gwmode = 1 or 2`) which controls whether Maximum or Mutual Supply will be 
used. Additionally, both options require variable efficiency to be turned on in the 
control (\*.ctl) file (`ieffmax = 1`). Both approaches operate from senior to junior using 
water right data provided. 

For the Maximum Supply approach, an operating rule allows the water right priority 
of wells associated with lands served by sprinklers to be made senior in order to 
apply water to lands served by sprinklers before any other source. To enable this 
functionality:

1.	Open the control (\*.ctl) file in a text editor and set the `isprink` parameter to 1. 
Additionally, confirm variable efficiency is being considering by verifying the `itsfile` 
parameter is set to 10 and the `ieffmax` parameter is set to 1.
2.	Set the water use approach variable (`gwmode`) in the irrigation parameter (\*.ipy) 
file to 1 to indicate the maximum supply option.
3.	If appropriate, verify that acreage served by sprinkler and/or ground water supplies 
is not zero. If the acreage served by sprinklers is zero or no ground water acreage is 
included, then sprinklers cannot be operated at a senior priority.
4.	Include a Type 21 operating right where the administration date reflects a senior 
value that will cause wells with sprinklers to operate first.

For the Mutual supply approach there is no operating rule required and wells operate 
according to the priority provided in the well water right file. 

1.	Open the control (\*.ctl) file in a text editor and set the `isprink` parameter 
to 1. Additionally, confirm variable efficiency is being considering by verifying the 
`itsfile` parameter is set to 10 and the `ieffmax` parameter is set to 1.
2.	Set the water use approach variable (`gwmode`) in the irrigation parameter (\*.ipy) 
file to 2 to indicate the mutual supply option.
3.	No operating rule is necessary.

During a natural flow simulation, operating rule data is not read. Therefore natural 
flows are calculated using a Maximum Supply approach if the irrigation parameter (\*.ipy) 
file variable `gwmode` is set to 1 and the control file (\*.ctl) variables are set as 
follows: `itsfile = 10`, `ieffmax = 1`, `isprnk = 1`. If any of the above are not set 
appropriately the Mutual Supply approach is used.
