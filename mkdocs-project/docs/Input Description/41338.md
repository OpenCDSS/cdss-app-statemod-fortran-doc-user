# Out-of-Priority Diversion with Plan Direct (ityopr=38) #

The type 38, Out-of-Priority Diversion, operating rule provides a method to divert to a reservoir or a diversion out-of-priority with respect to a 
reservoir based on the upstream storage statute. Source 1 is the senior reservoir right that is being subordinated. Source 2 is the destination reservoir 
water right that is diverting out-of-priority. The destination is a reservoir or ditch. A plan ID is used to track the volume of water that must be paid 
back should the subordinated reservoir right go unsatisfied. The following comments are provided to assist in using and interpreting this rule:

* The user must supply an “Out-of-Priority (OOP) Plan ID” associated with the OOP diversion.
* When multiple structures divert with respect to the same subordinated reservoir right, they may be provided the same OOP Plan ID or different OOP Plan ID’s. 
Separate OOP Plan ID’s are recommended if the user is interested in monitoring the demand and supplies associated with each OOP diversion. A combined OOP Plan ID 
is recommended if the user is not interested in monitoring the demand and supplies associated with each OOP diversion.
* The administration number provided to the operating rule is typically just senior to the senior subordinated reservoir right.
