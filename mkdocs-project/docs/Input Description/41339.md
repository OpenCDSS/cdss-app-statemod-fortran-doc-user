# Alternate Point Direct (ityopr=39) #

The type 39 operating rule allows a structure to divert at an Alternate Point using a water right that is assigned to another structure (i.e. not assigned to 
the Alternate Point). The alternate point can be located upstream or downstream of the destination structure. The rule allows water to be diverted at one or 
both locations up to the decreed amount. Source 1 is the water right that allows the diversion. Source 2 is the location in the network where the Alternate 
Point will be administered. The destination must be a diversion and is typically (but not required to be) the structure associated with Source 1.  The following 
comments are provided to assist in using and interpreting this rule:

* If the source structure is no longer capable of diverting, its capacity is typically set to zero in the diversion structure file.
* The administration number provided to the operating rule is typically equal to or slightly junior to the decreed water right.
* The source water right may operate as a standard direct flow right and as an alternate point. The total amount diverted at the decreed location and the alternate 
point are limited to the decreed amount, demand, available supply, etc. When the variable `iopsou(2,1)` = 0 is the right is used as both a direct flow and alternate point. 
When the variable `iopsou(2,1)` = 1 the right is only used as an alternate point.
* When the alternate point is a diversion, results are reported in the Stream Report (\*.xdd) as follows:
	* At the destination, the diversion is reported as From Carrier by Other.  
	* At the source structure, the diversion is reported as From River by Other and Carried, Exchange or Bypassed.  The Total Supply associated with the alternate point 
diversion is therefore zero (diversion less carried water is zero)
* When the alternate point is a well, results are reported in the Stream Report (\*.xdd) as follows:
	* At the destination, the diversion is reported as From Carrier by Other.  
	* At the source structure, the well pumping is reported as From Well and Carried, Exchange, or Bypassed.  The Total Supply associated with the alternate point diversion 
is therefore zero (well pumping less carried water is zero).
