# Direct Flow Demand File - Monthly (*.ddm) #

The monthly direct flow demand file contains demands for direct diversions for each month of the simulation period. Monthly data is required when 
the diversion station variable `idvcom` is set to 1 (monthly total demand) or 3 (monthly irrigation water requirement). Data should be entered in the 
order of the structure file (\*.dds). See [Section 7.4.7](../Standard Modeling Procedures/747.md) for a discussion of various approaches available for specifying demand data; demands may be 
specified as a total at the headgate or as a consumptive irrigation water requirement at the farm. This file is read by subroutine **`MDAINP`**.
