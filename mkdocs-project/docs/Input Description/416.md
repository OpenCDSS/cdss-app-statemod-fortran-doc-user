# Stream Flow File - Monthly (\*.rim or \*.xbm) #

The streamflow file may contain total baseflows or gains for each month of the simulation period. The control variable `iopflo` identifies which is 
expected; total baseflow (1) or gains (2). When this file is generated outside StateMod or is generated by StateMod and saved for historic purposes, 
it is commonly named \*.rim. When this file is generated by the StateMod baseflow module it is typically named \*.xbm. The user is recommended to rename 
a StateMod generated baseflow file named \*.xbm to \*.rim to ensure the preservation of a historic baseflow file and a continuous flow of results from 
the baseflow module to the simulation module. This file is read by subroutine **`MDAINP`**.
