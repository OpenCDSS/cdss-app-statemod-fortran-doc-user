# Direct Flow Exchange Direct (ityopr=24) #

The type 24 operating rule allows a direct flow diversion's water right (`ciopso(1)`) to be exchanged to another direct flow structure, reservoir or plan 
(`ciopde`). The exchange can occur from the river or by a carrier. The amount diverted can be limited to the amount available (Diversion) or its CU (Depletion). 
The following comments are provided to assist in using and interpreting this operating rule:

* This operating rule controls both the source and exchanged (destination) diversion or storage. Any shortages at the source location are shared with the destination based 
on ownership of each. 
* The percent ownership can be supplied that limits the exchange of the source water right.
* The consumptive use of the supply data can be specified to limit the exchange. The efficiency of water use for the exchanged water is set in the plan (\*.pln) file. It may 
be set to a fixed efficiency for all months, a constant value for each of 12 months or to the efficiency of the source water right structure.
* The source water right may be transferred to a diversion, reservoir or plan (`ciopde`). When the destination is a plan, the user is typically trying to 1. Satisfy a T&C 
Plan obligation or 2. Temporarily store the water in an Accounting Plan. 
	* If a portion or all of the source water right has been changed and the destination is a changed water rights plan, it is recommended the user not use this rule and 
instead implement Changed Water Rights plan operations (See [Section 7.11](../Standard Modeling Procedures/711.md) and [Section 4.13.26](../Input Description/41326.md).
* Because a direct flow exchange right may be used to serve both a direct flow right and as a direct flow exchange right, the administration number assigned to the operating 
rule is used in the analysis for both the direct flow and the direct flow exchange (i.e. it is not overridden by the source water rights administration number). 
* Direct flow exchange may be controlled over a season by using the monthly on/off switch (`imonsw(im)`). Note the monthly on/off switches only control the exchange operation 
(i.e. the source water right continues to operate independent of the monthly on/off switch). 
* Monthly and Annual exchange limits are required as input.
* The exchange amount is the minimum physical water available, remaining decree of the exchanging right (e.g. some of the decree may have been used for direct diversion 
purposes), the exchange potential between the destination and exchange locations, the monthly and annual exchange limits and the destination structureâ€™s capacity. 
* Carrier losses associated with intervening structures may be provided if variable `OprLoss` is > 0 or = -1 and the variable `dumx` = 1-10 or < -12. Note carrier losses are 
routed back to the system using the return flow parameters associated with the carrier structure.
* Terms and Conditions (T&C Plans) may be calculated if the source 2 variable (`ciopso2`) is set to a T&C plan. The variable `iousou(4,1)` is used to indicate how and when 
T&C demands are calculated. 
	* If the user is implementing T&C on a changed water right, it is recommended the user implement Changed Water Rights plan operations (See [Section 7.11](../Standard Modeling Procedures/711.md) 
and [Section 4.13.26](../Input Description/41326.md)) and associate the T&C plan when the water is released from the Changed Water Rights plan.
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = -1 the destination must be an accounting plan and the T&C Obligation is calculated when water is released from that Accounting 
plan using a type 27 or 28 rule.
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = 1 a standard return pattern is used to calculate the T&C Obligation. A Standard Return Pattern calculates the T&C Obligation to be:
		* \\(\text{T&C Obligation (standard)} = (\text{Data in the return flow file (\*.urm)}) \times ((\text{Released Water}) \times (1.0 - \text{CU Factor}))\\) where the CU Factor is provided in row 5. The first value 
in a standard return flow table corresponds to the month diverted, the second to the month after a diversion, etc. Data that associates a Plan ID with any number of Return 
Flow Location(s), Percent(s), and Return Table ID(s) is provided in the plan Return File (\*.prf).
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = 2 a fixed return pattern is used to calculate the T&C Obligation. A Fixed Return Pattern calculates the T&C Obligation to be:
		* \\(\text{T&C Obligation (fixed)} = (\text{Data in the return flow file (\*.urm)}) \times (\text{Released Water})\\) The first value in a fixed return flow table corresponds to the first month in 
the simulation (e.g. January for a calendar year simulation), the second month to February (again for a calendar year simulation), etc. Data that associates a Plan ID with 
any number of Return Flow Location(s), Percent(s), and Return Table ID(s) is provided in the plan Return File (\*.prf).
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = 3 a mixed return pattern is used to calculate the T&C Obligation. Mixed Return Pattern contains both a Standard and Fixed component 
and calculates the T&C Obligation to be:
		* \\(\text{T&C Obligation (standard)} = (\text{Data in the return flow file (\*.urm)}) \times ((\text{Released Water}) \times (1.0-\text{CU Factor}))\\) where the CU Factor is provided in row 5. The first value 
in a standard return flow table corresponds to the month diverted, the second to the month after a diversion, etc. Data that associates a Plan ID with any number of Return 
Flow Location(s), Percent(s), and Return Table ID(s) is provided in the plan Return File (\*.prf).
		* \\(\text{T&C Obligation (fixed)} = (\text{Data in the return flow file (\*.urm)}) \times (\text{Released Water})\\) The first value in a fixed return flow table corresponds to the first month in 
the simulation (e.g. January for a calendar year simulation), the second month to February (again for a calendar year simulation), etc. Data that associates a Plan ID with 
any number of Return Flow Location(s), Percent(s), and Return Table ID(s) is provided in the plan Return File (\*.prf).
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = 4 a default return pattern is used to calculate the T&C Obligation. A Default Return Pattern has a standard component that uses 
historic return flow data associated with the source water right to calculate the T&C Obligation. 
	* If the variable `ciopso2` is set to a T&C Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` is greater than zero then CU Factors are expected to be provided in card 5. Note the CU Factors typically 
represent negotiated values to, but not necessarily the same as, the efficiency of the Transfer From Structure. Also these factors are only used when `iopsou(4,1)` = 1 (Standard 
Return) or 3 (Mixed Return) even though they are required as input.
* Water diverted by a Type 24 operating rule are reported in the Stream Report (\*.xdd) as follows:
	* At the source, the water exchanged to the destination is reported as Carried, Exchanged or Bypassed.  
	* At the destination, the water diverted is reported as From River by Other.
