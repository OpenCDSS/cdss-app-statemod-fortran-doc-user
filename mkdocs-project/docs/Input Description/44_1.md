# River Gage File (*.rig)

The river gage file is used to describe the name and location of nodes where gaged streamflows are located. Gaged streamflows have a 
historical time series in the historical stream flow file (\*.rih). This file is part of a future enhancement that clearly separates 
data in the river station file (\*.ris) into gaged and non gaged flow locations. Currently this file is used by the daily baseflow module 
only. This file is read by subroutine **`VIRIN`**.

| Row-data							| Variable						| Description 								|				
| ------------------				| --------------------			| --------									|
| Station Data						|								|											|
| 1									| 								| Format (a12, a24, a12, 1x, a12)			|
| 1-1								| crunid(1)						| Stream Gage station ID					|
| 1-2								| runnam(i,1)					| Station name								|
| 1-3								| cgoto(1)						| River node with a stream gage				| 
| 1-4								| crunidy(1)					| Daily Stream station ID (for daily model only). See [Section 7.17](../Standard Modeling Procedures/717.md) for a detailed discussion. |
| | 																| Enter Stream station ID (`crunid`) if daily data will be provided for this station. Monthly data controls. |
| | 																| Enter another stream station ID to use the daily distribution of another but weight values by the monthly total in \*.rim file. Monthly data controls. |
| | 																| Enter 0 to use the average daily value from the monthly total in the \*.rim file. Monthly data controls. |
| | 																| Enter 3 to use the daily value provided in the daily river (\*.rid) file. Daily data controls. |
| | 																| Enter 4 to use a daily pattern developed by connecting the midpoints of monthly data. Monthly data controls. |

Repeat for the number of stream gages
