# Reservoir Storage with Special Limits Direct (ityopr=41) #

The type 41 operating rule allows a reservoir to store reservoir water right up to the volume of water stored in an Out-Of-Priority plan. It 
was originally developed to simulate the so called “1955 Exchange” on the Blue River that limits storage in Green Mountain to the amount of 
water diverted out-of-priority by Denver and Colorado Springs with respect to Green Mountain Reservoir. The following are noted:

* Source 1 should be a reservoir water right supplied in the reservoir right file (\*.rer). Note when this right is tied to a type 41 operating 
rule it is turned off and StateMod prints a warning. By turning this right off, StateMod ensures this right no longer diverts as a standard reservoir 
but instead is controlled by information in the Type 41 operating rule.
* The administration number assigned in the reservoir right file overrides the administration number assigned in the operating rule. Note if the 
administration numbers are not equal, StateMod warns the user that the data in the reservoir right file controls.
* The destination should be a reservoir.
* The variable `intern` is used to store up to 10 plans that might limit the reservoir storage.
* The intervening plans should be Out-of-Priority (type 9) Plans.
