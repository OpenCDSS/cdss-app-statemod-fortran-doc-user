# Delay Table File - Daily (*.dld) #

The daily delay table file contains coefficients to lag return flows. If the variable `interv` of the 
control file is a positive value, then `interv` values are expected for every pattern and data is expects 
to be provided as a percent. If the variable `interv` of the control file is a -1, then the number of 
values are specified for each pattern and data is expected to be provided as a percent. If the variable 
`interv` of the control file is a -100, then the number of values are specified for each pattern and data 
is expected to be provided as a decimal. This file is read by subroutine **`MDAINP`**. 

| Row-data							| Variable						| Description 								|				
| ------------------				| --------------------			| --------									|
| Control Data						| 								| 											|
| 1	 								| 								| Format (a8, i4, (12f8.2))
| 1-1								| idly							| Delay table ID
| 1-2								| ndly(1)						| Number of entries in delay table `idly`
| 									| 								| Include only if variable `interv` of the control file is equal to -1 or -100
| 1-3								| dlyratd(j,1)					| Delay factor for time period j
| 									| 								| Include as a percent if variable `interv` of the control file is positive or equal to -1
| 									| 								| Include as a decimal if variable `interv` of the control file is equal to â€“100

Include `ndly` or `interv` delay entries

Repeat for the number of delay tables used in the diversion station file
