# Historic Streamflow File - Monthly (*.rih) #

The monthly historic streamflow file is used by the baseflow module to estimate Base flows at gaged and ungaged locations. The monthly historic 
streamflow file is also used by the report module to compare simulated results to gaged observations. Note, the base flow module may be executed 
with missing streamflow data (specified by -999) to allow mans' impact to be removed prior to filling missing data gaps using a technique such as 
regression. This file is read by subroutine **`VIRGEN`**.
