# Carrier with Loss (ityopr=45) #

The type 45 operating rule provides a method to divert water to a carrier with loss. The carrier then delivers water to a diversion or reservoir. 
The source may be a diversion water right or, if delivering to a reservoir, a diversion or reservoir water right. The type 45 rule can include transit 
losses on up to 10 intervening structures. Also it allows the user to specify a percent of the source right that is owned. This routine is similar to 
type 11 but includes more extensive treatment of transit losses and water right ownership. The following are noted:

* A diversion is implicitly constrained by the capacity of the destination structure (variable `ciopde`). 
* The source water right may operate as a standard direct flow right and/or as a carrier. When the variable `iopsou(2,1)` = 0 the right is used as a carrier 
only. When the variable `iopsou(2,1)` = 1 the right is used as both a direct flow right and a carrier right.
* If a source right is used by both a direct flow and operating rule total diversions by both the direct flow and operating rule are not allowed to exceed 
the decreed capacity. 
* If the destination is a diversion, the source should be a diversion water right.
* **If the destination is a diversion, the demand should be specified at the location where the destination is located** (i.e. not the carrier location). 
Therefore any transit losses between the carrier headgate and the destination will be calculated by StateMod and implicitly included in the river headgate 
demand. 
* If the destination is a reservoir, the source should be a diversion water right or a reservoir water right.
* **If the destination is a reservoir, the demand is calculated at the location where the reservoir is located** (i.e. not the carrier location). Therefore any 
transit losses between a river headgate and the destination will be calculated by StateMod and implicitly included in the river headgate demand.
* If the destination is a reservoir and the source is a diversion right, the operating rule diversion IS NOT CHARGED against the reservoir’s decree.
* If the destination is a reservoir and the source is a reservoir right, the operating rule diversion IS CHARGED against the reservoir’s decree.
* Transit losses are reported with the carrier structure, not the destination.
* When the destination is an off-channel reservoir and the source is its water right, the administration location (`ciopso2`) may be used to administer the 
reservoir right at a diversion location located on the mainstem. This diversion location is implicitly treated as a carrier.
* When the miscellaneous limit (`oprlimit`) is set to a non zero value indicating a limit is provided the source constraint (`ipsou(2,k)` should be set to 1 to 
indicate the source water right is controlled by this operating rule. Without this constraint, water may be diverted under the source right, not this operating rule.
* When the miscellaneous limit (`oprlimit`) is set to 2 the diversion is limited to both the destination demand (`ciopde`) and the demand of the reservoir structure 
listed in row 4. The demand of the reservoir structure listed in row 4 is obtained from the monthly target file (\*.tam) or daily reservoir target file (\*.tad). Note 
that when the demand (`ciopde`) is a reservoir the monthly target (along with the capacity, etc.) is implicitly used to limit the amount diverted to a reservoir. However 
since a reservoir's capacity may go up or down during a time step the volume diverted may exceed the target value. When data is assigned herein the target is also used 
as a volumetric limit that cannot be exceeded in a given time step.  This option is, typically, only used when the destination is a Recharge Reservoir. 
* When the miscellaneous limit (`oprlimit`) is set to 3 the diversion is limited to both the destination demand (`ciopde`) and the demand of the diversion structure 
listed in row 4. The demand of the diversion structure listed in row 4 is obtained from the monthly diversion demand file (\*.ddm) or daily diversion demand file (\*.ddd).
* When the miscellaneous limit (`oprlimit`) is set to 4 the diversion is limited to both the destination demand (`ciopde`) and the monthly and annual limits specified 
by the type 47 operating rule listed in row 4. 
* Results for a type 45, Carrier with Loss, are reported in the Stream Report (\*.xdd) as follows:

	1. At the destination, the diversion is reported as From Carrier by Other, 
	2. At the carrier structure, the diversion is reported as From River by Other, loss is reported as From River Loss, and Carried, Exchange or Bypassed is From River 
by Other less From River Loss.  The Total Supply associated with the carrier is zero (diversion less loss less carried water equals zero)
