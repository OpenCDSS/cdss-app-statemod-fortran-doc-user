# Well Demand File - Daily (*.wed) #

The daily well demand file contains well demands or a daily pattern for each day of the simulation period. To simplify the preparation of daily data, 
StateMod allows the user to provide daily data or a pattern to be used with monthly data. When the well station variable `cdividwy` is set to 3 the well 
station variable `cdividw` is used to indicate daily data controls and any monthly data provided in the monthly direct flow demand file (\*.wem) is ignored. 
When the diversion station variable `cdividwy` is set to any ID including its own (`cdividw`) StateMod uses daily data as a pattern to estimate daily data from 
monthly data using the same approach described under daily streamflow data ([Section 4.36](../Input Description/436.md)).

This file is only required if the model is operated in a daily mode with wells on (control file variable `iwell` = 1). Data can be entered with stations entered 
in any order. This file is read by subroutine **`DAYDATA`**.
