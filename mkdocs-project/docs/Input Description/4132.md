# Reservoir Release to a Diversion or Reservoir or Carrier (ityopr=2) #

The type 2 operating rule provides a method to release water to a reservoir, direct flow structure or a carrier via 
the river. In addition, it can be used to constrain a diversion to the capacity of up to 10 intervening structures or 
carriers. Note a diversion is implicitly constrained by the capacity of the destination structure (variable `ciopde`, row-data 1-6).
