# Direct Flow Demand File - Daily (*.ddd) #

The daily direct flow demand file contains direct diversion demands or a daily pattern for each day of the simulation period. 
Data should be entered in the order of the structure file (\*.dds). To simplify the preparation of daily data, StateMod allows 
the user to provide daily data or a pattern to be used with monthly data. When the diversion station variable `cdividy` is set to 
3 the diversion station variable `cdivid` is used to indicate daily data controls and any monthly data provided in the monthly direct 
flow demand file (\*.ddm) is ignored. When the diversion station variable `cdividy` is set to any ID including its own (`cdivid`) StateMod 
uses daily data as a pattern to estimate daily data from monthly data using the same approach described under daily streamflow data 
([Section 4.36](../Input Description/436.md)).

This file is only required if the model is operated in a daily mode. Data can be entered with stations entered in any order. This file 
is read by subroutine **`DAYDATA`**.
