# Historic Diversion File - Monthly (*.ddh) #

The monthly historic diversion file is used by the baseflow module to estimate Base flows at gaged and ungaged locations. It is used by the report 
module to compare simulated results to gaged observations. This file is read by subroutine **`VIRGEN`**.
