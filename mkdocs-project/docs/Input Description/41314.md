The type 14 operating rule provides a method to divert water to a reservoir or direct flow structure using another structureâ€™s water rights. It is similar 
to the type 11 operating rule except the amount diverted is constrained by the demand of the structure associated with the source water right. Because it is 
an extension of the Type 11 operating rule, the amount diverted by a Type 14 rule is constrained by the source water right, carrier capacity, and the demand 
of the source structure. The following are noted:

* When the variable `iopsou(4,1)` is equal to 0, the diverting structure's demand is limited to the monthly value read from the direct flow demand (\*.ddm) file. 
When the variable `iopsou(4,1)` is greater than 1, the diverting structure's demand for the year is limited to the annual value read as variable `iopsou(4,1)`. 
* The source water right may operate as a standard direct flow right and/or as a carrier. When the variable `iopsou(2,1)` = 1 is the right is used as a carrier 
only. When the variable `iopsou(2,1)` = 0 the right is used as both a direct flow right and a carrier right.
