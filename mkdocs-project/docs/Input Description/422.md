# Well Demand File - Monthly (*.wem) #

The monthly well demand file contains demands for well structures for each month of the simulation period. Data may be entered in any order 
(i.e. its order is independent of the structure file). Monthly data is required when the diversion station variable `idvcom` is set to 1 (monthly 
total demand) or 3 (monthly irrigation water requirement). Note when a well structure is tied to a diversion the total demand is provided in the 
direct diversion station file and no monthly well demand data is required. This approach should have the control file (\*.ctl) variable `icondem` set 
to 6. See [Section 7.4.7](../Standard Modeling Procedures/747.md) for a discussion of various approaches available for specifying demand data; demands may be specified as a total at the headgate 
or as a consumptive irrigation water requirement at the farm. This file is read by subroutine **`MDAINP`**.
