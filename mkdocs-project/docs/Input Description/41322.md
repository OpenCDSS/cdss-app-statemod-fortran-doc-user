# Soil Moisture Use (ityopr=22) #

The type 22 operating rule allows the administration date for soil moisture use to be specified for all ditches and wells with one operational 
right. This operating rule is commonly applied when soil moisture accounting is included in the analysis (control variable `soild` = 1). Note this 
operating rule expects, and checks, that the control file (\*.ctl) variables `itsfile`, `ieffmax` and `soild` are set appropriately. As described in 
[Section 4.2](../Input Description/42.md), the control variable `soild` allows water deliveries in excess of a diversion's consumptive demand to be stored in the soil moisture 
zone. This operating rule allows the administration date to be specified that controls when water stored in the soil moisture zone is used (e.g. 
after surface rights, after well right, etc.). Note the soil moisture accounting requires the variable efficiency option be on by setting the annual 
time series file control variable (`itsfile`) equal to 10.
