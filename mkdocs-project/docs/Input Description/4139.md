# Reservoir Target (ityopr=9) #

The type 9 operating rule allows reservoir releases to be made from a reservoir to satisfy a target reservoir content specified in the \*.tar 
file. This operating rule is commonly applied to simulate flood control operations where forecast data is are unavailable. In addition, it may 
be used to simulate hydropower operations when a hydropower demand cannot be specified by other means.
