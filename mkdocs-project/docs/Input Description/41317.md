# Rio Grande Compact - Rio Grande River Direct (ityopr=17) #

The type 17 operating rule was developed specifically for the Rio Grande River's portion of the Rio Grande Compact. Unlike most other 
operating rules, it requires two rows of data. The first row of data expects:

* The destination to be an Instream flow (i.e. an Instream flow right just below the Rio Grande at Labatos gage). 
* Source 1 to be the stream gage that represents the index flow (i.e. Rio Grande at Del Norte) 
* Source 2 to be the stream gage used to adjust to the discharge at the Instream flow location (i.e. the combined discharge of the Conejos River near La Sauses). 

The second row of data expects:

* `Qdebt` is the year when annual obligation calculations begin to include adjustments for the cumulative surplus / shortage (i.e. 1985) 
* `Qdebtx` is the initial surplus / shortage (acft) for Rio Grande (e.g. 944,000 * 60%). 
* Source 3 is not used. 
* The Source 4 coefficient represents the annual yield (acft/yr) of the Closed Basin Project to the Rio Grande River. 
* The Source 5 coefficient represents the annual discharge of the Norton Drain South to the Rio Grande River.
