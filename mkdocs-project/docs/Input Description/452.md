# Reservoir Return Flow File (*.rrf) #

The Reservoir return file contains return flow data that is used to route reservoir seepage back to the 
stream over time. If no reservoir return flow data is provided any reservoir seepage is considered a loss. 
Similarly if the percent return does not equal 100% then the balance (100%-value specified) is considered a 
loss. This file is read by subroutine **`GETRES`**.
