# South Platte Compact Storage (ityopr=50) #

For a complete description of how the South Platte compact is implemented in StateMod see [Section 7.16.3](../Standard Modeling Procedures/7163.md).  The Type 50 operating rule temporarily 
stores water available to the South Platte Compact in priority in an administrative plan.  It is used in conjunction with a type 40 operating 
rule to insure the South Platte Compact does not call out any water right located in water district 64 (e.g. upstream of the Washington county 
line). In addition it is used with a type 40 operating rule to release water to the compact itself after every junior water right not located 
in water district 64 has had the opportunity to insure it was not called out by the compact. The following comments are provided:

* The type 50 operating rule turns off the source instream flow right so that it is completely controlled by the type 50 operating rule.
* The administration number assigned to the operating rule used to store water in the South Platte Compact plan (type 50) should be 17332.00000, 
the value associated with the South Platteâ€™s decreed priority of June 14, 1897.
* Results for a type 50, South Platte Compact Storage, are reported in the Stream Report (\*.xdd) as follows:
	* At the destination compact plan, the diversion is reported as From River by Other because it is diverted by an operating rule.  The Total Supply 
equals From River by Other that equals Water Use To Other. The station In/Out reports the diversion as a return flow because it is non-consumptive. 
The Station Balance reports River Divert as the amount diverted to the plan.
