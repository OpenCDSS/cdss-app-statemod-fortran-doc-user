# Reservoir to Reservoir Transfer (Bookover) with a Plan (ityopr=34) #

The type 34 operating rule allows a reservoir to reservoir transfer (bookover) to occur where the destination water may be reusable or increase an OOP 
plan obligation. It is commonly used to transfer water from one reservoir storage account to another in a particular month. The following are noted:

* The destination reservoir may be the same or different than the source reservoir. If they are different the destination reservoir must be located 
downstream of the source reservoir.
* If the delivery method is a release from the reservoir directly to a demand or reservoir (i.e. no release to the river) the diversion type (`cdivtyp`) 
should be set to Direct. If the delivery method is the river and the delivery is intended to meet the destination’s demand the diversion type (`cdivtyp`) 
should be set to Diversion.
* The amount transferred can be limited to the amount of water diverted by another operating rule (specified under variable `ciopso(2)`). 
* The amount transferred can be limited to the demand of a diversion structure (specified in field `ciopso(2)`). 
* The amount transferred can be limited to the volume of water in an Out-of-Priority (OOP) plan (specified in field `ciopso(2)`).
* The amount transferred can be booked from one reservoir to another by a carrier (pipeline). 
* If the variable `OprLimit` is set to 1 the operating rule ID specified in row 4’s monthly and annual limits will be increased and limit the amount released. 
Also because the capacity of the source structure of the operating rule ID specified in row 4 has already been adjusted the source structure’s capacity will 
not limit the amount diverted.
* If water is being transferred from an OOP plan in one reservoir to an OOP plan in another reservoir then:
	* Source 1 should be the source reservoir
	* Source 2 should be the OOP plan at the source reservoir
	* The destination should be the reservoir receiving the bookover
	* The plan data should be the OOP plan at the destination reservoir
