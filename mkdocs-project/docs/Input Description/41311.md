# Carrier Right to a Ditch or Reservoir (ityopr=11) #

The type 11 operating rule provides a method to divert water to a reservoir or direct flow structure using another structure’s water rights. In addition, 
it can be used to constrain a diversion to the capacity of up to 10 intervening structures. The following are noted:

* A diversion is implicitly constrained by the capacity of the destination structure (variable `ciopde`). 
* The source water right may operate as a standard direct flow right and/or as a carrier. When the variable `iopsou(2,1)` = 1 the right 
is used as a carrier only. When the variable `iopsou(2,1)` = 0 the right is used as both a direct flow right and a carrier right.
* If the source is a diversion right, the administration number used for the operating rule is the priority of the diversion right, not the priority 
assigned to the operating rule. 
* If several operating rules use the same water right, diversions are not allowed to exceed the decreed capacity. 
* If the destination is a diversion, the demand is the destination structure's demand. Any return flows use the return flow pattern and locations assigned 
to the destination structure in the diversion station file (\*.dds).
* If the destination is a reservoir, the operating rule demand is the destination reservoir’s capacity. 
* If the destination is a reservoir and the source is a diversion right, the operating rule diversion IS NOT CHARGED against the reservoir’s decree.
* If the destination is a reservoir and the source is a reservoir right, the operating rule diversion IS CHARGED against the reservoir’s decree.
* If carrier losses are to be included use a type 45 operating rule.

| 									| 								| +n Number of intervening structures (max = 10) 
| 									| 								| -n Include -12 for monthly on/off values minus n intervening structures. Note, when a negative value is provided, it should be -13 or less).
| 1-5								| ioprsw(1)						| Annual On/Off Switch
| 									| 								| 0 = off 
| 									| 								| 1 = on
| 									| 								| +n = Begin in year n

| 1-6								| ciopde						| Destination diversion or reservoir ID
| 1-7								| iopdes(2,1)					| Destination structure account, 
| 									| 								| 1 for a diversion destination
| 									| 								| +n for a reservoir destination,
| 									| 								| +n Account served by this right
| 									| 								| -n Fill the first n accounts using the ratio of their ownership
| | | |
| Source Data | | |
| 1-8								| ciopso(1)						| Water right ID under which the diversion occurs. Note may be a diversion right or a reservoir right
| 1-9								| iopsou(2,1)					| 0 = The source water right (`ciopso(1)`) is left on (i.e. it can be used as a both a direct flow right and this operating rule).
| 									| 								| 1 = The source water right (`ciopso2(1)`) is turned off (i.e. it can only be used by this operating rule)
| 1-10								| ciopso(2)						| NA = the water right is administered at the location specified in the appropriate water right file
| 									| 								| +n = the water right is administered at location n (e.g. a reservoir right is administered at a the location of a carrier)
| 1-11								| iopsou(4,1)					| 0 = Not used
| Type Data | | |
| 1-12								| ityopr(1)						| 11
| | | |
| Plan Data | | |
| 1-13								| creuse						| NA If the carrier loss is not associated with a recharge source +n
| 									| 								| Enter Recharge Plan ID If the carrier loss is a recharge source. Note the Plan type must be recharge (type 8)
| | | |
| Diversion Type | | |
| 1-14								| cdivtyp						| NA
| | | |
| Conveyance Loss (%) | | |
| 1-15								| OprLoss						| 0
| | | |
| Miscellaneous Limits | | |
| 1-16								| OprLimit						| 0 = No carrier limitation
| 									| 								| +n = Carrier limit (cfs) Note this value is an additional constraint that is imposed on a carrier since the capacity of the diverting structure and all carriers is an implicit constraint. This value is typically used to represent the maximum diversion rate allowed to fill a reservoir.
