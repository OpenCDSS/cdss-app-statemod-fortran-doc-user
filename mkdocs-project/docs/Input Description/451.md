# 4.51	Plan Return Flow File (*.prf) #

The Plan return file contains return flow data that is used to route canal seepage back to the stream 
over time (generally used with recharge plans) and plan efficiency information (generally used with T&C 
plans). For recharge plans, if no plan return flow data is provided, any plan seepage is considered a loss. 
Similarly if the percent return does not equal 100% then the balance (100%-value specified) is considered a 
loss. For T&C plans, the total amount of water that returns to the stream is calculated as a function of the 
amount diverted, the efficiency (or inefficiency) of the diverson (`eff`), and the return flow pattern.  The plan 
return file (\*.prf) contains two pieces of data associated with calculating return flows from a plan; where the 
return flow enters the stream system (`crtnid`) and when those returns enter the system over time (`irtndlPP`).  The 
plan station file provides the efficiency value to be used.  As described in [Section 4.49](../Input Description/449.md), StateMod allows the user 
to provide either a constant efficiency value to use over all time or 12 efficiency values to be used for individual 
months. This file is read by subroutine **`GETRES`**.
