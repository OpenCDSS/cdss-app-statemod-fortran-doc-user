# Import to a Plan (ityopr=35) #

The type 35 operating rule provides a method to import water from outside the system to an accounting plan. An import 
structure should be specified with the same ID in both the diversion station file (\*.dds) and plan file (\*.pln) using 
[Plan Type 7](../Input Description/449.md). The destination accounting plan must be located directly downstream of the import diversion/plan, intervening 
structures in this rule are not recommended. Monthly import values should be specified as negative demands in the diversion 
demand file (\*.ddm). If the imported supplies are reusable,  designate the reuse plan when the imported water is released 
from the accounting plan.
