# Direct Diversion Station File (*.dds) #

The direct diversion station file contains information to describe the physical properties of each direct diversion in the system. This file is read by subroutine **`DATINP`**. Note that the 
average efficiency data provided with this file (**`divefc`**) is not used when the variable efficiency approach is operated (see control file variable `ieffmax`) and the structure is included 
in the irrigation water requirement file (\*.ddc/\*.iwr).

| Row-data							| Variable						| Description 								|				
| ------------------				| --------------------			| --------									|
| Station Data						|								|											|
| 1									| 								| Format (a12, a24, a12, i8, f8.2, 2i8, 1x, a12) |
| 1-1								| cdivid(1)						| Diversion station ID
| 1-2								| divnam(i,1)					| Diversion name							|
| 1-3								| cgoto							| River node where diversion is located		|
| 1-4								| idivsw(1)						| Switch; 0 = off, 1 = on						|
| 1-5								| divcap(1)						| Diversion capacity (CFS)					|
| 1-6								| dumx							| Not currently used						|
| 1-7								| ireptyp(1)					| If a general replacement reservoir option (type 10) is used.|
| |																	| 0 = Do not provide general replacement reservoir benefits |
| |																	| 1 = Provide 100% replacement |
| |																	| -1 = Provide depletion replacement |
| 1-8								| cdividy(1)					| Daily Diversion ID (not used for monthly model). See [Section 7.17](../Standard Modeling Procedures/717.md) for a detailed discussion
| |																	| Enter station ID (`cdivid`) if daily data will be provided for this station. Monthly data generally controls.
| |																	| Enter another station ID to use the daily distribution of another but weight values by the monthly total in \*.ddm file. Monthly data generally controls.
| |																	| Enter 0 to use the average daily value from the monthly data in the \*.ddm file. Monthly data controls.
| |																	| Enter 3 to use the daily value from the daily demand (\*.ddd) file. Daily data controls.
| |																	| Enter 4 use a daily pattern developed by connecting the midpoints of monthly data. Monthly data controls.

| 2									| 								| Format(12x, a24, 12x, 2i8, f8.2, f8.0, i8) |
| 2-1								| usernam(1)					| User name									|
| 2-2								| idvcom(1)						| Data type switch 							|
| 									|								| 1 = monthly total demand provided [(Section 4.17)](../Input Description/417.md) |
|									|								| 2 = annual total demand provided [(Section 4.18)](../Input Description/418.md) |
|									|								| 3 = monthly irrigation water requirement provided [(Section 4.17)](../Input Description/417.md) |
|									|								| 4 = annual irrigation water requirement provided [(Section 4.17)](../Input Description/417.md) |
|									|								| 5 = estimate to be zero |
| 2-3								| nrtn(1)						| Number of return flow locations or table references |
| 2-4								| divefc(1)						| System efficiency switch. Enter 0-100 % for a constant value each month. Enter a negative value to provide 12 values, one for each month. Note this data is not used when the maximum efficiency approach is used (see control file variable `ieffmax`) unless the structure type (`irturn`, below) is a carrier. |
| 2-5								| area(1)						| Recent Irrigated Acreage (ac) |
| 2-6 								| irturn(1) 					| 1 |
| 2-7 								| demsrc(1) 					| Demand source code (used for documentation purposes and non-StateMod applications to determine if a structure supplies an irrigation demand.) |
| | 																| 1 = Irrigated acreage from GIS database |
| | 																| 2 = Irrigated acreage from structure file (tia) |
| | 																| 3 = Irrigated acreage from GIS database, the primary component of lands served by multiple structures |
| | 																| 4 = Same as 3 but data is from the structure file (tia) |
| | 																| 5 = Secondary component of lands served by multiple structures |
| | 																| 6 = Municipal, industrial or transmountain structure (no acreage data expected) |
| | 																| 7 = Carrier structure (no acreage data expected) |
| | 																| 8 = Acreage data provided by the user |
| | 																| -999 = Acreage data unknown |

| 3-1 								| diveff(1,12) 					| Efficiency % by month for the year type selected (water year, irrigation year, calendar year)
| | | |
| Return Flow Data					| 								| |
| 4 								| 								| Format (36x, a12, f8.2, i8) |
| 4-1 								| crtnid(1) 					| River node receiving return flow |
| 4-2 								| pcttot(1) 					| Percent of return flow to this river node |
| 4-3 								| irtndl(1) 					| Delay (return flow) table for this return flow |
