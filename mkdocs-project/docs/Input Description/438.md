# Instream Flow Demand File - Daily (*.ifd) #

The daily instream flow demand file contains instream flow demands or a daily pattern for each day of the simulation period. Data should be 
entered in the order of the structure file (\*.ifs). To simplify the preparation of daily data, StateMod allows the user to provide daily data 
or a pattern to be used with monthly data. When the instream flow station variable `cifridy` is set to 3 the instream flow station variable `cifrid` 
is used to indicate daily data controls and any monthly data provided in the annual instream flow demand file (\*.ifa) is ignored. When the diversion 
station variable `cifridy` is set to any ID including its own (`cifrid`) StateMod uses daily data as a pattern to estimate daily data from monthly data 
using the same approach described under daily streamflow data ([Section 4.36](../Input Description/436.md)).

This file is only required if the model is operated in a daily mode. Data can be entered with stations entered in any order. This file is read by 
subroutine **`DAYDATA`**.
