# Reservoir Release to a Diversion by Exchange with the River (ityopr=4) #

The type 4 operating rule provides a method to allow a direct flow diversion to occur via a reservoir exchange. In general, an exchange is required whenever 
a reservoir cannot serve a direct flow diversion or reservoir directly. When the destination variable `ciopde` (row-data = 1-6) is a structure ID, the exchange 
is not constrained by the structures water right. When the destination variable `ciopde` (row-data = 1-6) is a water right, the exchange is limited to its decreed 
amount less any diversions that have been charged to that right. For a direct diversion the limit is constrained to diversions that have occurred in the current 
time step. For a reservoir, the limit is constrained by storage that has occurred over the administrative season. The type 4 operating rule implicitly limits the 
exchange amount to ensure no senior, intervening water rights are impacted. Intervening rights are those water rights that occur between the diversion and a point 
downstream where the releasing reservoir's water is available.
