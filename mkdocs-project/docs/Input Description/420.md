# Instream Flow Demand - Monthly (*.ifm) #

The monthly instream flow demand file contains instream flow demands for each month of the simulation period. Data should be entered in the 
order of the structure file (\*.ifs). To allow StateMod to be backward compatible with old data sets, this file is required only when monthly 
data is required (e.g. when the instream flow station (\*.ifs) file variable `iifcom` is set to 1). 

Note negative monthly demands are estimated to be a forecast which is currently only used by the [Rio Grande compact](../Standard Modeling Procedures/7162.md) simulations (see operation rule 
types 17 and 18). Also for use by the Rio Grande compact the variable `rspilx` may be used to specify the month when a spill occurred and the prorated 
portion of the spill attributed to Colorado. Data should be entered by year with stations in any order. This file is read by subroutine **`MDAINP`**.

| 2-1								| idyr							| Year
| 2-2								| cistat						| Demand station ID
| 2-3								| diverm(1-12,1)				| Demands (AF) for months 1-12. A negative number is treated as a forecast.

Repeat for the number of instream flow stations

Repeat for each year of the simulation

Note `rspilx` is only used by the Rio Grande operating rules (types 17 and 18).
