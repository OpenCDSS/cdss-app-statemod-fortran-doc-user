# Base Flow Data (*.rib) #

Base flow data is used by the baseflow module to estimate base flows at river nodes that do not have hisoric records using the following formula:

$$\text{Target} (im) = \text{Current Storage} (im) - (\text{Current Storage} (im) - \text{Forecast} (im)
- \text{End Target}) / (\text{Months Remaining} +1)$$

$$FlowX = (FlowB(1) \times coefB(1) + FlowB(2) \times coefB(2) + ....) + pf \times (FlowG(1) \times coefG(1)
+ FlowG(2) \times coefG(2)+ ....)$$

Where:
	
\\(FlowX\\) =	Flow at intermediate node to be estimated

\\(FlowB\\) =	Base flow station(s)

\\(FlowG\\) =	Gain flow station(s)

\\(pf\\) =	Proration factor for gain term

\\(coefB\\) =	Base flow coefficient

\\(coefG\\) =	Gain flow coefficient

The first term \\((FlowB(1) \times coefB(1) + FlowB(2) \times coefB(2)+ ....)\\) typically represents upstream gaged flows. The second term 
\\(pf \times (FlowG(1) \times coefG(1) + FlowG(2) \times coefG(2)+ ....)\\) typically represents the gain between gages. This file is read by subroutine **`VIRGEN`**.
