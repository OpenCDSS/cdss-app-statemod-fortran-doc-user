# Reservoir with a Reuse Plan to a User by Exchange (ityopr=33) #

The type 33 operating rule provides a method to release water from a Reservoir with a Reservoir Reuse plan (type 3 or 5) 
to a reservoir, direct flow, instream flow or a carrier located upstream of the reservoir, by exchange when the receiving structures 
return flows can be reused. The amount released may equal the destinations demand (Diversion) or consumption (Depletion). In addition, 
it can be used to constrain a diversion to the capacity of up to 10 intervening structures or carriers. Note a diversion is implicitly 
constrained by the capacity of the destination structure (variable `ciopde`, row-data 1-6).

| 									| 								| 0 = Reservoir demand is not adjusted
| 									| 								| +n = Reservoir demand is limited to not exceed CIR/n; where n (%) is the efficiency of reservoir water use that is limited to not exceed the max system efficiency. Note a +n requires the variable efficiency option (`ieffmax`) from control file be on
