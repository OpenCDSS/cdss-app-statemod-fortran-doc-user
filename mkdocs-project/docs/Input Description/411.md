# Reservoir Station File (*.res) #

The reservoir station file contains information to describe the physical properties of each reservoir in the system. Reservoirs may be operated such that they 
will not (`iressw` = 1 or 2) or will (`iressw` = 3) divert above their target. When a reservoir stores above its target and subsequently releases that water as part 
of an operating rule, the net result is a paper fill which is charged against the reservoir rightâ€™s one fill limitation and additional water becomes available 
downstream of the reservoir. This file is read by subroutine **`GETRES`**.

| 1-4								| iressw(1)						| Switch for reservoir;
|									| 								| 0 = off, 
|									| 								| 1 = on, Do not adjust for dead storage. Do not store above reservoir targets
|									| 								| 2 = on, Do not store above reservoir targets. Adjust maximum ownership and initial storage of the last account by the dead storage volume
|									| 								| 3 = on, Do not adjust for dead storage. Do not store above reservoir target. Charge ability to store above a reservoir target to the decree (e.g. paper fill)
| 1-5								| rdate(1)						| Date for one fill rule administration 
|									| 								| +n = month for reoperation at the beginning of the month (e.g. 1 = January 1, 2 = February 1, etc.)
|									| 								| -1 = do not administer the one fill rule.
| 1-6								| cresidy(1)					| Daily reservoir ID (not used for monthly model). See [Section 7.17](../Standard Modeling Procedures/717.md) for a detailed discussion 
|									| 								| Enter station ID (`cresid`) if daily data will be provided for this station. Monthly data controls. 
|									| 								| Enter another station ID to use the daily distribution of another but weight values by the monthly total in the reservoir target (\*.tar) file or reservoir end-of-month (\*.eom) file. Monthly data controls.
|									| 								| Enter 0 to use the average daily value from the monthly data in the reservoir target (\*.tar) file or reservoir end-of-month (\*.eom) file. Monthly data controls.
|									| 								| Enter 3 to use the daily value from the daily reservoir target (\*.tad) file or reservoir end-of-day (\*.eod) file. Daily data controls.
|									| 								| Enter 4 use a daily pattern developed by connecting the midpoints of monthly data. Monthly data controls.
|									| 								| Enter 5 to use a daily pattern developed by connecting the end points of monthly data.
