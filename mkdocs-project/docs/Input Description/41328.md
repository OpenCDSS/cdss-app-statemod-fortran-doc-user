# Reservoir or Reuse or Accounting Plan to a User by Exchange (ityopr=28) #

The type 28 operating rule provides a method to release water from a Reservoir, or ReUse Plan (type 4 or 6),  or Out-of-Priority (OOP) Plan (type 9), 
or Accounting Plan (11),  or Changed Water Right Plan (type 13) to a diversion, reservoir, instream flow, or carrier by exchange. In addition, it can 
be used to release water to an instream flow node or reach. The following are noted:

* A “ReUse Plan” is a plan type that can be used identify the location of a reusable water supply associated with a CU transfer or transmountain import 
(see [Section 7.8](../Standard Modeling Procedures/78.md) for more details about plans). 
* An “Accounting Plan” is a plan type that is used for accounting only (see [Section 7.8](../Standard Modeling Procedures/78.md) for more details about plans). 
* An “OOP Plan” is a plan type that is associated with a diversion or storage taken out-of-priority by a type 38 operating rule. 
* A “Changed Water Right Plan” is a plan type that can be used to identify the location of water diverted by a Changed Water Right Operating Rule (type 26).   
* If the source is a Reuse, Accounting Plan or Changed Water Right, the destination  may be reusable (i.e. `creuse` is a reuse plan (type 3 or 4). 
* If the source is an Changed Water Right Plan (plan type 13), the variable `Oprlimit` must have a value between 5 and 9.
* If the source is a reservoir, the source data may be tied to an out-of-priority Plan (i.e. `creuse` is an OOP plan (type 9)). 
* If carrier losses are calculated (`OprLoss`>0), the return flow pattern and return locations are those assigned to the SOURCE (CARRIER) structure in the
diversion station file (\*.dds) (e.g. if the source is a water right tied to structure X, then the return flow pattern and locations are those provided for 
structure X in the diversion station file (\*.dds)).
	* The variable `OprLimit` is used to constrain a release to to an operating rule that contains monthly and annual limits, the amount diverted by another 
operating rule or, if the source is a Changed Water Right, the operating rule that diverted the Changed Water Right.  If the variable `OprLimit` set to 1 or 
6, StateMod will warn the user a value of 1 or 6 are not currently operational but are reserved for potential future  enhancements.
	* If the variable `OprLimit` is set to 2, 4 or 7, the operating rule ID specified in row 4’s monthly and annual limits will be decreased and limit the amount 
released.
	* If the variable `OprLimit` is set to 3, 4 or 8, the operating rule ID specified in row 4 or 5 will limit a release to the amount diverted byanother operating rule.
	* If the variable `OprLimit` is set to 4 or 9, the operating rule ID specified in row 4 should be an operating rule with monthly and annual limits (similar to 
`Oprlimit` = 2), the operating rule ID specified in row 5 should be the operating rule that will limit a release to the amount diverted by that operating rule (similar 
to `OprLimit` = 3).
	* If the variable `OprLimit` is set to 5, 7, 8 or 9, the source should be a Changed Water Right Plan (type 13) and operating rule ID specified in row 4, 5 or 6 should 
be the operating rule that diverted the Changed Water Right.
* Terms and Conditions (T&C Plans) may be calculated if the source 2 variable (`ciopso2`) is set to a T&C plan. The variable `iousou(4,1)` is used to indicate how and 
when T&C demands are calculated.
	* If the user is implementing T&C on a changed water right, it is recommended the user implement Changed Water Rights plan operations 
(See [Section 7.11](../Standard Modeling Procedures/711.md) and [Section 4.13.26](../Input Description/41326.md)) and associate the T&C plan when the water is released from the Changed Water Rights plan.
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = -1 the destination must be an accounting plan and the T&C Obligation is calculated when water is released from that 
Accounting plan using a type 27 or 28 rule.
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = 1 a standard return pattern is used to calculate the T&C Obligation. A Standard Return Pattern calculates the T&C 
Obligation to be:
		* \\(\text{T&C Obligation (standard)} = (\text{Data in the return flow file (\*.urm)}) \times ((\text{Released Water}) \times (1.0 - \text{CU Factor}))\\) where the CU Factor is provided in row 5. The first 
value in a standard return flow table corresponds to the month diverted, the second to the month after a diversion, etc. Data that associates a Plan ID with any number 
of Return Flow Location(s), Percent(s), and Return Table ID(s) is provided in the plan Return File (\*.prf).
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = 2 a fixed return pattern is used to calculate the T&C Obligation. A Fixed Return Pattern calculates the T&C Obligation to be:
		* \\(\text{T&C Obligation (fixed)} = (\text{Data in the return flow file (\*.urm)}) \times (\text{Released Water})\\) The first value in a fixed return flow table corresponds to the first month 
in the simulation (e.g. January for a calendar year simulation), the second month to February (again for a calendar year simulation), etc. Data that associates a Plan ID 
with any number of Return Flow Location(s), Percent(s), and Return Table ID(s) is provided in the plan Return File (\*.prf).
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = 3 a mixed return pattern is used to calculate the T&C Obligation. Mixed Return Pattern contains both a Standard and Fixed 
component and calculates the T&C Obligation to be:
		* \\(\text{T&C Obligation (standard)} = (\text{Data in the return flow file (\*.urm)}) \times ((\text{Released Water}) \times (1.0-\text{CU Factor}))\\) where the CU Factor is provided in row 5. The first 
value in a standard return flow table corresponds to the month diverted, the second to the month after a diversion, etc. Data that associates a Plan ID with any number 
of Return Flow Location(s), Percent(s), and Return Table ID(s) is provided in the plan Return File (\*.prf).
		* \\(\text{T&C Obligation (fixed)} = (\text{Data in the return flow file (\*.urm)}) \times (\text{Released Water})\\) The first value in a fixed return flow table corresponds to the first month 
in the simulation (e.g. January for a calendar year simulation), the second month to February (again for a calendar year simulation), etc. Data that associates a Plan ID 
with any number of Return Flow Location(s), Percent(s), and Return Table ID(s)is provided in the plan Return File (\*.prf).
	* When `ciopso2` = Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` = 4 a default return pattern is used to calculate the T&C Obligation. A Default Return Pattern has a standard component that uses 
historic return flow data associated with the source water right to calculate the T&C Obligation. 
	* If the variable `ciopso2` is set to a T&C Plan ID and `iopsou(4,1)` is greater than zero then CU Factors are expected to be provided in card 5. Note the CU Factors typically 
represent negotiated values related to, but not necessarily the same as, the efficiency of the Transfer From Structure. Also these factors are only used when `iopsou(4,1)` = 1 
(Standard Return) or 3 (Mixed Return) even though they are required as input.
* Releases from a Plan by a Type 28 operating rule are reported in the Stream Report (\*.xdd) as follows:
	* At the source, the water release to the destination is reported as Carried, Exchanged or Bypassed.  
	* At the destination, the water diverted is reported as From River by Other.
