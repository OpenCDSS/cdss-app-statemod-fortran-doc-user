# Irrigation Water Requirement File - Daily (*.ddx) #

The daily consumptive water requirement (\*.ddx) file contains the CU requirement for direct diversion and 
well only structures for each day of the simulation period. It is only used when the control file (\*.ctl) 
variable efficiency control (`ieffmax`) = 1. To simplify the preparation of daily data, StateMod allows the 
user to provide daily data or a pattern to be used with monthly data. When the diversion station variable 
`cdividy` is set to the diversion station variable `cdivid` daily data controls and any monthly data provided 
in the monthly consumptive water requirement file (\*.ddc) is ignored. When the river station variable `cdividy` 
is set to any ID other than its own direct flow station variable `cdivid`. StateMod uses daily data as a pattern 
to estimate daily data using the same approach described under daily streamflow data ([Section 4.36](../Input Description/436.md)).

This file is only required if the model is operated in a daily mode with variable efficiency (control 
file `itsfile` = 1 or 10). Data can be entered with stations entered in any order. This file is read by subroutine 
**`DAYDATA`**.
