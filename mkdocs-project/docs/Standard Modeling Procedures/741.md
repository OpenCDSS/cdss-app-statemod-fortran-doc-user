# Change the Period of Record #

1.	Open the control file (\*.ctl) in a text editor.
2.	Revise the beginning (`iystr`) and/or ending years (`iyend`); note that input data must be complete for 
the period of record selected.
3.	Save the revised control file (\*.ctl); consider saving with a new file name to preserve the original file.
4.	Confirm the revised control file (\*.ctl) is reflected in the response file (\*.rsp).
5.	Simulate the model.
