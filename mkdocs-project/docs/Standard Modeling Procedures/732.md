# Variable Efficiency #

1.	In the control file (\*.ctl), set the variable efficiency switch (`ieffmax`) to 1.
2.	In the control file (\*.ctl), set the annual time series file switch (`itsfile`) to 1 or 10. As described in the 
control file documentation, when the control variable `itsfile` is set to 10 conveyance, maximum flood, and sprinkler 
efficiency data provided by structure and year are used. Set the control variable `ieffmax` to 1 so irrigation water 
requirement (\*.iwr) data provided for every diversion and well only structure by year is used. 
3.	If not already created in support of a StateCU scenario, create an annual time series (\*.ipy) file for every 
irrigation structure served by a diversion or wells only. The annual time series file is a primary input to the 
StateCU model; see the StateCU User’s Manual for information on the format and content of this file.
4.	If not already created in support of a StateCU scenario, create a monthly irrigation water requirement (\*.iwr) 
file for every irrigation structure in the scenario. The StateMod formatted irrigation water requirement file (\*.ddc) 
is an output from StateCU; see the StateCU User’s Manual for information on the format and content of this file. 
5.	Include the annual time series file (\*.ipy) and irrigation water requirement file (\*.iwr) in the response file 
(\*.rsp).
