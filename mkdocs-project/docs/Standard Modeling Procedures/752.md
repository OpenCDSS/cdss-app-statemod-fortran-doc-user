# Reservoir Release Operations #

StateMod has several operating rules that allow water to be released from a reservoir to a direct flow 
diversion, including operating rule Types 2, 3, 4, 10, 11 and 14. See the Operating Rules Decision Tree 
in [Section 4](..\Input Description\413.md) for all operating rules associated with reservoirs. 

* Releases are limited to available water in the source reservoir and account, the capacity of the diversion 
structure, the downstream channel capacity, and the structure demand. For operating rules that release via 
exchange (e.g. Type 4), reservoir releases are also limited to the exchange potential in the intervening reach. 
* Operating rules require the user to specify which account the releases will be made from, and releases 
can be made via the river or via a carrier/conduit depending on the operating rule type selected.
