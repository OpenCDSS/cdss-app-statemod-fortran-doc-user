# Basin-Specific Operations and Compacts #

There have been several operations implemented in StateMod to represent basin-specific operations and/or administration, most 
typically Interstate Compacts.  The discussion below provides insight as to how StateMod is set up to represent these operations; 
the user is encouraged to review the basin-specific documentation and the individual basin models for more information.

Although designed for a specific operation, in many cases these operations can be adapted to represent operations in other models or 
areas of the State.  This section discusses how the basin-specific operations have been implemented, however the user should consider 
other opportunities on how to adapt the functionality to use these operations in other modeling efforts.
