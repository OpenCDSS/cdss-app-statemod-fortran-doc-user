# Add/Change a Demand #

1.	For direct flow demand: Edit the diversion demand file (\*.ddm) using the StateDMI commands and either set 
the monthly demand or read in an external StateMod formatted file (\*.stm) with the demand.
2.	For reservoir demand: Edit the reservoir demand file (\*.tar) using the TSTool commands and either set the 
minimum/maximum monthly demands or read in an external StateMod formatted file (\*.stm) with the demands.
	* See [Section 4](..\Input Description\40.md) for information on flood control operations (e.g. use of “-1” in the target file)
3.	For instream flow demand: Edit the instream flow demand file (\*.ifa/*.ifm) using the TSTool commands and 
either set the monthly demand or read in an external StateMod formatted file (\*.stm) with the demand.
	* Use a monthly instream flow demand file (\*.ifm) to input a demand for each month in the simulation period.
	* Use an annual instream flow demand file (\*.ifa) to input twelve monthly demands to be used for each year.
	* Set the demand type in the instream flow station file (\*.ifs).
5.	Confirm the revised demand files (\*.ddm, \*.tar, \*.ifa/m) are reflected in the response file (\*.rsp) and 
simulate the model.
