# Monthly Binary Well File #

StateMod prints a direct access binary well file (\*.b42) that describes water supply and use for each 
well structure. The record length is 92 bytes. Note a typical read statement is as follows:

$$Irecs = ((iy-iystr0) \times 12 + (im-1)) \times numdivw + nw + numtop$$

`Read(42,rec=irecs) (dat(i), I=1,ndivw)`

Where:

\\(Irecs\\)		= the binary record to read

\\(iy\\) 		= the year of interest

\\(iystr0\\)	= the starting year

\\(im\\)		= the month of interest

\\(numdivw\\)	= the total number of wells

\\(nw\\)		= the well of interest

\\(numtop\\)	= the total number of header cards 

\\(dat(i)\\)	= the data read

\\(ndivw\\)		= the number of well data elements (18)

Fields 1-14 are exactly the same as the Binary Direct Diversion file.

Repeat for every well

Repeat for every month of simulation
