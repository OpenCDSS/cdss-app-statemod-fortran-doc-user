# Replacement Reservoir File (*.xrp) #

The Replacement Reservoir File (\*.xrp) is a standard output when a Replacement Reservoir (type 10) 
operating rule is specified. It was developed to provide detailed replacement reservoir operation information. 
It is particularly useful when more than one replacement reservoir is operational. Note that a release may not 
equal a diversion if the release is limited to the structures consumptive use. This “Depletion” Vs “Diversion” 
option is implemented by structure using variable `ireptyp` in the diversion station (\*.dds) file.
