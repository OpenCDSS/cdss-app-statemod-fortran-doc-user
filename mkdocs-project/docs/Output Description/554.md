# Daily Binary Direct Diversion File #

StateMod prints a daily direct access binary diversion binary file (\*.b49) that describes water use at 
each river node and day. The record length is 160 bytes. Note a typical read statement is as follows:

$$Irecs = ((iy-iystr0) \times 12 + (im-1)) \times numsta \times 31 + is + numtop$$

`Read(49,rec=irecs) (dat(i), i=1,ndiv)`
