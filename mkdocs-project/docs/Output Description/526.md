# Log File (*.log) #

The Log File (\*.log) contains a log of the simulation operations. The log file contains important 
information for the user; it is recommended the user review the log file and understand and/or address 
if necessary any warnings after each model execution. Additionally, if the model fails to execute, the 
log file provides information as to why the model will not execute to completion.
