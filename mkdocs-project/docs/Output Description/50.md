# Remarks #

There are numerous output files available from the three modules available in StateMod as described below. For 
scenario management, the files are given the simulation name plus a standard three character suffix as described 
below. [Section 6 - Model Operation](../Model Operation/6.md) describes the output command and how to obtain each output file. Note that the 
output command NA indicates the file is generated by a module automatically. Also, unless otherwise noted, all output 
files are monthly.
