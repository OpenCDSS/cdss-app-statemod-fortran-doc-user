# Structure Summary File (*.xss) #

The Structure Summary File (\*.xss) is a standard output when the variable efficiency option is used 
(control variable `ieffmax` = 1). The report describes structure data related to area, demand, maximum 
efficiency surface water use, ground water use, soil storage, consumptive use and returns. It was developed 
to provide data similar to that provided by StateCU, the State's consumptive use model.  

The header describes the structure (diversion or well ID), account and name. In addition, it describes the 
administration number, on/off switch, owner, and decreed amount for each water right located at this structure. 
It then contains a time series for the following:
