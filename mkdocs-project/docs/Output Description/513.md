# Other Base Flow Files (*.xbm) #
The Base Flow Estimate for Model Input file (\*.xbm) contains gaged and ungaged data in the same format as the gaged base 
flow estimate file (\*.xbg). This file is commonly used as an input file to the Simulate Module. 

The Log File (\*.log) contains a log of the base flow module's operation. The log file contains important information for the user; 
it is recommended the user review the log file and understand and/or address if necessary any warnings after each model execution. 
Additionally, if the model fails to execute, the log file provides information as to why the model will not execute to completion.
