# Detailed Call Data #

The State Model has the ability to print detailed call data for a diversion, reservoir or instream flow by setting 
the control file (\*.ctl) call variable `icall = 1` and the call right variable (`ccall`) to the water right of interest. 
The following are noted:

* Detailed call output is limited to a diversion, reservoir or instream flow right (i.e. operating rules and wells are 
not currently supported). 
* Results are printed to the \*.log file for each iteration. Note that the call can change during a time step if new water 
(e.g. reservoir releases and non-downstream return flow) become available. Therefore results are printed for every iteration 
of every time step and the volume of output can be quite large. 
* Although the output is limited to when a decree is operating, the volume of water reported as diverted in the detailed 
output is for the entire structure, not just the right.
