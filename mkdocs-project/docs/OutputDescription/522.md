# Reservoir Summary File (*.xre) #

The Reservoir Summary File (\*.xre) describes diversion, release, storage and stream flow data at 
river nodes that contain a reservoir. The header describes the reservoir ID, account and name. In addition, 
it describes the administration number, on/off switch, owner, and decreed amount for each water right located 
at this river node. It then contains a time series for the following:
