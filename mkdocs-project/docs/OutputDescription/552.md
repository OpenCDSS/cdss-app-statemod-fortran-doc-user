# Monthly Binary Reservoir File #

StateMod prints a direct access binary reservoir file (\*.b44) that describes water supply and use for each 
reservoir and account. As with other reservoir outputs, there are binary outputs for the reservoir as a whole 
(Account 0) and for the individual reservoir accounts (Account 1, 2, 3, etc). The record length is 160 bytes. 
Note a typical read statement is as follows:

$$Irecs = ((iy-iystr0) \times 12+(im-1)) \times nrsactx+ir1+numtop$$

`Read(44,rec=irecs) (dat(i), i=1,nres)`

Where:

\\(Irecs\\)		= the binary record to read

\\(iy\\) 		= the year of interest

\\(iystr0\\) 	= the starting year

\\(im\\)		= the month of interest

\\(nrsactx\\)	= the total number of active reservoirs (`nract`) and total number of active and inactive accounts (`numown`) (i.e. `nrsactx = nrsact + numown`) 

\\(ir1\\)		= the reservoir account of interest (the first account is always the reservoir total)

\\(numtop\\)	= the total number of header cards \\((numsta+numdiv+numifr+numres+numrun+numdivw+5+3*maxparm+2)\\)

\\(dat(i)\\)	= the data read

\\(nres\\)		= the number of reservoir data elements (29)

Fields 1-15 are exactly the same as the Binary Direct Diversion file.
