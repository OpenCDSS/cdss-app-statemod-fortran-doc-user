# Daily Binary Reservoir File #

StateMod prints a daily direct access binary reservoir file (\*.b50) that describes water use at each 
reservoir and account by day. The record length is 160 bytes. Note a typical read statement is as follows:

$$Irecs = ((iy-iystr0) \times 12 + (im-1)) \times nrsactx + ir1 + numtop$$

`Read(50,rec=irecs) (dat(i), i=1,nres)`
