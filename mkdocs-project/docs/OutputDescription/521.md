# Stream Summary File (*.xdd) #

The Stream Summary File (\*.xdd) describes all stream flow data at all river nodes. For nodes with stream gages, only the columns 
containing hydrology data described below (Upstream Inflow, Reach Gain, Return Flow, River Inflow, River Outflow) have non zero values. 
Nodes with reservoirs are similar to stream gage nodes but include the column River Divert, which may be positive if the reservoir 
diverts or negative if the reservoir releases. Instream reach data is printed for the upstream node and represents the minimum diverted 
within the reach. For detailed instream flow reach analysis, the file \*.xir, provides detailed data for each node within the instream 
flow reach. 

This summary file reflects information on “Available Flow”. Available Flow, as used by StateMod, is the minimum of the stream flow at that 
point on the river and all downstream locations. It is often quite different than the physical flow at that point on the river. Within 
StateMod, Available Flow is tracked and adjusted as each water right is operated by priority. However, Available Flow printed to the diversion 
summary report (\*.xdd) is the final value after all water rights have been operated. Therefore, Available Flow is the quantity of water that 
might be available to a future user at that location who would be the most junior in the system. 

In addition, Available Flow is often an indicator on why a structure may be shorted. In general, if the reported Available Flow is greater than 
zero, then a structure may be shorted only if it is limited by capacity or decree. The Available Flow may not be an indicator of why a structure 
is shorted if the structure is controlled by an operating rule or if the user has imposed limits on when the model will be allowed to re-operate 
(see the variable `ireopx` in the control (\*.ctl) file). The control file (\*.ctl) variables `icall` and `ccall`, discussed in more detail below, 
allow a user to evaluate the transient nature of the Available Flow value for an individual water right as it is operated in priority.

The header of the Stream Summary File (\*.xdd) describes the structure ID, account and name. In addition, it describes the administration number, 
on/off switch, owner, and decreed amount for each water right located at this river node. It then contains a time series for the following:
