# Monthly Binary Direct Diversion File (*.b43) #

StateMod prints a monthly direct access binary diversion binary file (*.b43) that describes water use at each river node. The record length is 160 bytes. A typical read statement is as follows:

$$Irecs = ((iy-iystr0) \times 12+(im-1)) \times numsta+is+numtop$$

`Read(43,rec=irecs) (dat(i), i=1,ndiv)`

Where:
	
\\(Irecs\\)	= the binary record to read

\\(iy\\) 		= the year of interest

\\(iystr0\\) 	= the starting year

\\(im\\)		= the month of interest

\\(numsta\\)	= the total number of stream nodes

\\(is\\) 		= the stream node of interest 

\\(numtop\\)	= the total number of header cards \\((numsta+numdiv+numifr+numres+numrun+numdivw+5+3*maxparm+2)\\)

\\(dat(i)\\)		= the data read

\\(ndiv\\)		= the number of diversion data elements (maxparm)

Structure Type Codes

| Code (na)					| Structure Type			|

| < 0						| Baseflow node<sup>1</sup>
| < 10,001					| Baseflow node only<sup>1</sup>
| 0							| Well Only
| 1-5,000					| Diversion
| 5,001 - 7,500				| Instream Flow
| 7,501 - 10,000			| Reservoir

<sup>1</sup>Note a code of 1 indicates a diversion, a code of -1 indicates a diversion with at baseflow, a code of â€“10001 indicates a baseflow node only.
