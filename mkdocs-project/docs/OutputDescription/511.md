# Base Flow Information File (*.xbi) #

The Base Flow Information file (\*.xbi) contains information associated with the base flow estimates but in a 
spreadsheet format for checking. It contains the following data: 

| #      | Column           | Description     |
| -----  | ---------------  | ------------    |                      
| 0      | Year             | Simulation Year                                             
| 0      | Mon              | The first month specified in the control file
| 0      | Days             | The number of days in the month
| 0      | River ID         | River station ID 
| 1      | Gaged Flow       | The streamflow provided in the stream flow file ([Section 4.14](../InputDescription/414.md))   
| 2      | Import (-)       | The total imports (indicated as negative diversion)                                                    
| 3      | Divert (+)       | The total of diversions upstream of the river ID. Provided in the diversion files (Section [4.15](../InputDescription/415.md), [4.16](../InputDescription/416.md), and [4.17](../InputDescription/417.md)) which result in a positive adjustment to the gauged flow    
| 4      | Return (-)       | The total of current and lagged return flows from upstream diversions and well pumping 
| 5      | Well Dep (+)     | The total of current and lagged stream depletions from wells (not adjusted for returns)
| 6      | Delta Sto (+)    | The total of upstream reservoir storage changes from data in the End of Month content file ([Section 4.21](../InputDescription/421.md)) which result in a positive adjustment to the gaged flow
| 7      | Net Evp (+)      | The total of upstream net evaporation occurring at upstream reservoirs which result in a positive adjustment to the gaged flow                                         
| 8      | Total Base Flow  | The estimated base flow w/o(-) Base Flow The estimated base flow with negative values set to zero
