# Plan Summary File (*.xpl) #

The Plan Summary File (\*.xpl) is a standard output when a Plan structure type is used. The report describes 
structure data related to a plan including its type, ID and Source. In addition it describes any operating rules 
that may use the plan (Use) or provide water to the plan (Src) and whether or not the operating rule tied to that 
plan is turned on.  Note if a plan source is not turned on, an operating rule that uses that plan as a source has 
its status reported as “off” and a warning is provided in the log file.  The data printed to a plan depends on the 
type of plan specified; plan types are listed below.
