# Model Operation #

The State Model is structured to perform one of four (4) interrelated activities: 

* Base Flows 
* Simulate 
* Report
* Data Check 

For a description of each option, see [Section 3.3](../Model Description/33.md) of this documentation. The model can be executed using 
either the StateMod Graphical User Interface available from the CDSS website or via a command line argument. 
If a command line argument is used, enter the model name and option as follows:

`statemod [file] [options]`

where:
 
`file` = base file name of the simulation 

| Option<sup>1</sup> | Description |
| -------------------------- 	 | --------------------	|
| `-v` or `-version`             | Print the program version
| `-u` or `-update`              | Print recent updates
| `-base` or `-baseflow`         | Perform baseflow option
| `-basex` or `-baseflowx`       | Perform baseflow option for ungaged areas only. Note: This option assumes gaged flows are natural flows.
| `-sim` or `-simulate`          | Perform simulate option with standard reports
| `-simx` or `-simulatex`        | Perform simulate option without standard reports
| `-rep` or `-report [options2]` | Perform report option
| `-chk` or `-check`             | Perform data check option

<sup>1</sup> If omitted, the PC version of the model defaults to requesting the desired option from the screen, while the Unix 
version prints an error message.

Except for the `-report` option, each of the above requests are straight forward and require only one command line argument. The 
`-report` option allows for one or two additional parameters in order to request the desired report and, as appropriate, desired station 
without requiring data from the screen by the user. Note, except for the standard output request (`-std`), the argument name is the same 
as the output file requested. Following are examples of the report option with second and third parameters supplies: 

| Argument<sup>1</sup>       	| Result           	|                           
| ------------------------		| --------------	|                                                                                
| -report -xnm               	| Detailed node accounting for all years and Detailed node accounting average               
| -report -xwb               	| Water Balance                                  
| -report -xwr               	| Water Right List sorted by basin rank          
| -report -xdg [-station id] 	| Direct Diversion, Instream Diversion and Gage graph file                                
| -report -xrg [-station id] 	| Reservoir graph file 
| -report -xwg [-station id] 	| Well graph file                                                              
| -report -xdc               	| Diversion comparison file
| -report -xrc               	| Reservoir comparison file   
| -report -xwc               	| Well comparison file
| -report -xsc               	| Stream flow gage comparison file       		
| -report -xcu               	| Diversions by ditch formatted for the CU model
| -report -xst               	| Standard diversion (\*.xdd) and reservoir (\*.xre) output
| -report -xsp               	| Special parameter report<sup>2</sup>.

<sup>1</sup> If omitted, the PC version of the model defaults to request the desired option from the screen, 
while the Unix version prints an error message.

<sup>2</sup> For the special parameter report the output type (e.g. diversion, reservoir, well, stream gage or All) 
and parameter (e.g. River Outflow) must be specified in the output request file.
