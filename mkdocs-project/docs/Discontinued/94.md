# Operational Right File (*.opr) #

Beginning with version 12.0 an operating rule file format was adopted that includes six (6) additional variables 
associated with water reuse, diversion type, etc. (see table below). When this discontinued format is provided the 
following format string should be entered at the top of the file: `# FileFormatVersion 1`. If the above string is not 
provided StateMod will try to read the file and try to determine the appropriate file type. Regardless if the file 
format string is or is not provided the discontinued operating rule file will assign the following default values:

| Data Type	       				| Variable					| Default Value |
| ---------------------------	| ------------------------	| ------------	|
| Associated Plan Data	        | creuse	        		| NA
| Diversion Type	        	| cdivtyp	        		| NA
| Conveyance Loss (%)	        | OprLoss	        		| 0
| Miscellaneous Limits	        | OprLimit	        		| 0
| Start Date	        		| IoBeg						| First year of operation
| End Date	        			| IoEnd						| Last year of operation
