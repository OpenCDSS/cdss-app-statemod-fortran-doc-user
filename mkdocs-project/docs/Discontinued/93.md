# Irrigation Parameter Yearly Data File - Annual (*.ipy) #

The annual CU time series file contains information required to perform calculations using a variable efficiency 
approach. The current standard is to provide 4 water supply and irrigation method combinations (Surface Supply Flood 
Irrigation, Surface Supply Sprinkler Irrigation, Ground Supply Flood Irrigation, and Ground Supply Sprinkler Irrigation). 
A discontinued but still supported format includes total ground water and total sprinkler data. 

When this discontinued format is provided the following format string should be entered at the top of the file:	`# FileFormatVersion 1`. 
If the above string is not provided StateMod will try to read the file and try to determine the appropriate file type. 
Regardless if the file format string is or is not provided the discontinued total ground water and sprinkler data are 
distributed to four land use types as follows:

| Water Supply Irrigation Method				| Approach							|
| --------------------------					| --------------------------		|
| Ground Supply Sprinkler Irrigation	 		| \\(= \text{Minimum  (Total Ground Water, Total Sprinkler Irrigation)}\\)
| Surface Supply Sprinkler Irrigation			| \\(= \text{Total Sprinkler} – \text{Ground Supply Sprinkler Irrigation}\\)
| Ground Supply Flood Irrigation				| \\(= \text{Total Ground Water} – \text{Ground Supply Sprinkler Irrigation}\\)
| Surface Supply Flood Irrigation				| \\(= \text{Maximum} (0.0 \text{, Total Area} - \text{Ground Supply Sprinkler Irrigation} – \text{Surface Supply Sprinkler Irrigation} – \text{Ground Supply Flood Irrigation})\\)
