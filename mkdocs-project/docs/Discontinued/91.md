# Response File (*.rsp)

The response file contains the names of all other data files required to run the model. This file is read by subroutine *`StateM`*. 
Note that Version 10.30 and greater allows a user to enter response file data using one of two formats; random and sequential. 
StateMod reads the first file type and based on the occurrence of the character ‘=’ in the first file name it determines if the 
file is random (contains a ‘=’) or sequential (does not contain a ‘=’).

The random file approach allows file names to be entered in any order as described below under Random Response Format. Any file type 
that is not required for a simulation is simply not included. Also any file name may be commented out by including a ‘#’ character 
in column 1. Its format is described in the [Chapter 4.0 Input Description](../InputDescription/40.md).

The sequential file contains file names or a dummy name for every file type. It is described below. Also to allow StateMod to be 
backward compatible, well data (\*.wes, \*.wer, \*.wem, and \*.weh), the monthly instream demand (\*.ifm), San Juan Recovery Plan 
sediment file (\*.sjr), annual time series file (\*.ipy), irrigation water requirement file (\*.iwr) and soil moisture file (\*.par) 
should not be provided unless specified in the control (\*.ctl) file. See files with footnotes in the following table.
